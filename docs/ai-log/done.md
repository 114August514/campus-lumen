### 2026-10-29 - Add USTC 词元计划 to the feasibility analysis

- Source: User pointed out that campus resources such as 词元计划 give students API keys.
- Result: `docs/project/feasibility.md` §2.1 records public facts read 2026-10-29. Sources: the platform user guide (project + API Key model, OpenAI-compatible `https://api.llm.ustc.edu.cn/v1`, keys kept server-side, 429 on quota), the model page (DeepSeek-V4-Flash 1M context, Qwen3.6, DeepSeek-V4-Pro) and the network-center 成长营 README (student-eligible models and multipliers; quota 30M/3h, 70M/12h, 100M/24h tokens). One analysis request (about 55k tokens) at 2× allows about 270 per 3h and 900 per day. Two integration options: a team key held server-side (the platform's recommended pattern, works for external judges) or student-supplied keys forwarded without storage. Economic, risk and legal sections and the conclusion now prefer the campus platform; commercial prices remain as the off-campus fallback.
- Unverified: logged-in terms (logging and retention), whether quota is per account or per project, and whether one project key may serve many students. These are confirmation items, not adopted decisions.
- Process note: the 2026-09-24 finding about 词元计划 had not been promoted into feasibility; recorded in `retrospective.md`.

### 2026-10-29 - Repair software-engineering documentation and record process gaps

- Source: After an audit of missing, over-constrained and superficial items, the user chose to fix documentation first.
- Result: Added `docs/project/detailed-design.md` (modules, routes, storage schema, state machines, algorithms, interfaces, technical debt), `reviews.md` (performed and missing reviews) and `retrospective.md` (per-phase problems, root causes, improvement list). Extended `requirements-spec.md` with design personas (labelled as non-research), use-case diagram and descriptions, user stories and a P→N→FR→UC→acceptance traceability matrix; `requirements-handoff.md` with a conclusion table, consolidated limitations and current status; `progress.md` with real timeline, WBS, two-member division of labour (AI agents listed as tools) and a risk register; `feasibility.md` with verified technical risks and a cited cost model (DeepSeek and Brave prices read 2026-10-29; Kimi price not confirmable, omitted).
- Corrections: `acceptance.md` F02 tightened to require both keyword discovery and direct read; `test-report.md` now records F02 and F18 as partial, F09 as passing only by the gap criterion, self-verification and unarchived screenshots as evidence limits, and AI-written profiles as unreviewed.
- Verification: strict `bun run ci:docs` passes.
- Follow-up: human review of the seven advisor profiles, peer approval of requirements, independent acceptance walkthrough, USTC user interviews; decisions on widening the reading allowlist and on real-model integration.

### 2026-10-29 - Mid-term integration, unified frontend and software-engineering docs

- Source: User asked for a mid-term review (requirements, feasibility, actual progress), a software-engineering repository organization, acceptance criteria first, and an excellent frontend showing the intended demo; then corrected scope to one 探索 → 发现 → 处理 flow for all types, simulated AI, and coordinator-owned frontend.
- Result: Branch `feat/midterm-demo` ([PR #21](https://github.com/114August514/campus-lumen/pull/21)) integrates #18, `codex/demo-high-priority`, #20 and the preserved Kimi work (`wip/kimi-frontend-2026-10-25`). New frontend: hash routes, lazy pages, unified catalog, per-kind comparison, live-discovery run timeline with stop/late isolation, entry evidence, AI send-confirm with current-topic-only unticked notes and five delivery states, demo route with synthetic sessions/AI outcomes/replays. Backend `POST /api/v1/analyses` simulated organizer (no model, no network, no storage, echoes received ids); allowlist adds MPI/ISTA hosts. Seven source-bound advisor profiles. Kimi workbench removed.
- Docs: `docs/project/` (index, feasibility, requirements-spec, acceptance, test-report, progress, user-guide), `docs/product/frontend-design.md` v1.1, archived legacy docs under `docs/archive/`, fixed requirement/status contradictions, AGENTS.md records the 2026-10-29 decisions.
- Verification: `bun run ci:frontend` (21 client + 125 web tests, UI rules, build; main JS gzip 156 kB); cargo fmt/clippy/test (34); `bun run api:check`; strict `bun run ci:docs`. Browser walkthrough at 1280/390/dark/keyboard with live direct reads of jzuming.github.io and cis.mpg.de/internships; results and deviations in `docs/project/test-report.md`. Developer walkthrough only, not student trial.
- Repository: with user approval, deleted squash-merged local branches and remote `claude/*` branches after `archive/*` tags (remote tags pushed for `claude/*`); removed old worktrees after committing their uncommitted content as WIP and tagging `archive/*-wip`.
- Follow-up: E05 GitHub CI on PR #21; browser walkthrough for F12/F13; full keyboard/screen-reader pass; real-model integration remains deferred; keyword search often hits verification pages.

### 2026-10-27 - Repair mistaken public associations without losing private records

- Source: User asked to continue the remaining demo work after the high-priority branch; recommended first item from the gap review.
- Result: Maintainers record splits in `apps/web/src/data/association-corrections.json` (strictly validated, public fields only). Public advisor/internship lists are rebuilt so every source of the merged object goes to exactly one split object; split objects show the correction reason/date. On startup, saved topic records are re-pointed only when their own saved source URLs identify one split object; otherwise (several objects, no match, or target already in the topic) they become "关联待确认" and the user chooses. Reasons, questions and saved sources are never read for the decision, copied or rewritten; pending records are excluded from comparison; repair is idempotent.
- Changed: `apps/web/src/lib/association-repair.ts` (new), `exploration-store.ts` (optional `association` note, `repairAssociations`, `resolveAssociation`), `advisors.ts`, `comparison-candidates.ts`, `app/App.tsx` (startup repair run once even under StrictMode, notices and choice UI), empty `association-corrections.json`, `tests/association-repair.test.ts`; task design §8.9 (originally §8.8; renumbered on the 10-29 merge).
- Verification: `bun test tests/*.test.ts tests/*.test.tsx` 82 pass (7 new); typecheck, Biome, `lint:styles` and build pass. Browser (local origin 5177) with a temporary synthetic split of `tianqi-chen` and two synthetic topics: FAQ-only record auto-relinked, two-page record pending then resolved by choice, reasons unchanged, startup notice shown, detail shows the correction; found and fixed a StrictMode double-initialisation that hid the notice. Correction file restored to empty and synthetic browser data cleared afterwards.
- Follow-up: Route-level splits need structured routes. Optional preparation/knowledgeable-participant entries and the full §7 walkthrough remain.

### 2026-10-27 - Publish high-priority demo branch to GitHub

- Source: User requested pushing the completed work to GitHub.
- Result: Committed the 28 scoped files as `968f6911e2b3a30f340afea136184d98d661d698` and pushed [codex/demo-high-priority](https://github.com/114August514/campus-lumen/tree/codex/demo-high-priority). Unrelated `.claude/`, old `tools/discovery-trial/` output and ignored work artifacts remain excluded. No PR or main merge requested.
- Verification: Rechecked the exact staged scope and `git diff --check`; fresh `git ls-remote` matched local HEAD at `968f691` after push. Prior runtime/browser/build evidence is below; no remote CI success is claimed.
- Local repair: Initial Git LFS pre-push failed with `gitobj/pack: bad pack header`. Verified four `._*` files in `.git/objects/pack` have AppleDouble magic and moved only those metadata sidecars to `.git/codex-appledouble-backup-1793095480`, preserving real pack/index files. Normal push then succeeded; Git pack diagnostics disappeared.

### 2026-10-27 - Integrate high-priority demo fixes

- Source: User asked to implement the high-priority audit items, then continue. Result is local on `codex/demo-high-priority`, fast-forwarded from main `7fae667` through remote `51e81dd`/`a374ab0`; prior audit log entries and untracked files preserved. No remote push/merge.
- Result: Campus Lumen naming, explicit topic editing and bounded cancellable streaming are integrated. Current-topic saved external candidates can enter comparison from saved records or the candidate list; retained body excerpts/sources/time are shown without inventing semantic conclusions. Topic-only resolution excludes other topics' saved objects/private notes. Repeated evidence saving preserves deduplication and private reasons; existing curated advisor interpretations remain separate from supplemental evidence.
- Content: Removed unsupported job-specific conditions and quality endorsements from internship comparison; detail/comparison/opportunity entry now reuse one set of corrected candidate fields. Original October 16 summaries remain labelled as unverified historical leads. MSRA's three/six-month conflict stays unresolved; the freshly read 2024 Shanghai systems notice is a different unconfirmed job identity, not grounds to overwrite the old distributed-training lead. Source review is documented in development.md and task design §8.8 (originally §8.7; renumbered on the 10-29 merge).
- Discovery: Added exact-host, slash-delimited paths for Microsoft Research opportunities/careers, Shanghai AI Lab recruitment, ByteDance campus positions and the OpenCompass repository. Kept address pinning, private-IP/redirect/size/time/concurrency limits; query/fragment credential-key inputs are rejected. Updated OpenAPI and backend/API/security/privacy docs; no model, paid provider or credential/session integration.
- Fresh checks: `bun run ci:frontend` passed (17 API-client + 75 Web tests, types, lint, UI checks and build; existing ~840 kB JS warning). `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/campus-lumen-target-20261027 cargo test --workspace` passed 24 tests; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and cargo formatting passed. `bun run api:types` regenerated the contract; strict `bun run ci:docs` passed with `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmp/campus-lumen-docs-venv UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-lumen-uv-cache UV_LINK_MODE=copy`. Live database migration/container/desktop checks were not rerun because no corresponding behavior changed.
- Actual walkthrough: Local API directly read the Microsoft Shanghai systems job page (one 2,777-character body). Browser on isolated test origin `127.0.0.1:5186` saved a new historical-job object, compared it alongside an old lead, saved a synthetic reason, edited topic conditions, reloaded and restored, then verified the second topic has no copied object/private record. Production client/run controller against the real API stopped on the first body snapshot (`sources=1`, `finished=false`) and retained it in cancelled state. Shanghai AI Lab joinus also returned one body; ByteDance campus HTML fetch failed truthfully without substituting stored data. No real student data or private content was sent. Screenshot and disposable script remain ignored under `work/2026-10-26-demo-high-priority/`.
- Environment: Installed Rust and uv through Homebrew to perform fresh checks. Moved 40 untracked AppleDouble metadata files into ignored work for preservation; the OS regenerated metadata, so Biome now excludes only `**/._*` and the flat Web/API-client test entry globs exclude hidden files. Standard frontend checks then passed with regenerated metadata still present. The separate existing Git pack sidecar diagnostic remains. Initial MkDocs import failure on the external-drive venv was resolved using a fresh temporary venv. Runtime code does not depend on work files or those temporary environments.
- Follow-up: Review/publish the local changes when requested; association repair, optional preparation/contact help, optional AI sending and full demo/student-benefit acceptance remain separate. Existing browser topics and the storage key/version were not migrated.


### 2026-10-26 - Audit current demo completeness

- Source: User asked what remains unfinished after pulling the renamed repository.
- Baseline: Local main and origin/main at `7fae667`. Reviewed requirements handoff §8.2, task design §7–8, milestones, logs, Web/API/store code and remote development-branch diff. No runtime implementation or branch integration changed.
- Implemented: Seven advisor and three internship candidates, multi-type entry/resource browsing, source-bound curated comparison, public HTML discovery/direct read, topic-private candidate/opportunity notes and persisted evidence. Browser on a separate local origin (`127.0.0.1:5186`) showed the candidates and internship comparison; selecting time requirements displayed MSRA's three-month text. Did not create personal records or send external queries.
- Findings: Batch/detail says MSRA requires six months while comparison/entry says three; several detailed location/mentoring/conversion claims lack supporting text in the retained source summaries. New external candidates can be saved but comparison resolves only the static candidate list; deep profiles cover two advisors/two internships. Live discovery remains academic-domain-only, excluding the displayed industrial recruitment domains. Main lacks topic editing UI, cancellation/streaming, association repair and complete optional preparation/contact flow; general resource entries do exist. Curated interpretations do not update automatically from supplemental evidence.
- Branch distinction: Remote `feat/topic-edit-and-bounded-discovery` has two commits absent from main: `51e81dd` (Campus Lumen rename/workspace docs) and `a374ab0` (topic editing and bounded cancellable streaming). Its log reports prior checks, which were not reexecuted here; no open PR was returned by the current GitHub search. Main still displays Campus Agora.
- Fresh verification: `bun run ci:frontend` failed when Biome/Bun scanned local `._*` AppleDouble files; initial typecheck and UI-source rules passed. Explicit normal test paths passed (14 API-client + 65 Web tests), and Biome on 16 tracked Web source/data files passed. `bun run build` passed (main JS 829.61 kB / 213.00 kB gzip warning). No browser console warnings/errors were returned in the inspected session. No backend/live external discovery verification or strict MkDocs build: cargo/rustc/uv are not on PATH and localhost:8080 refused the health request. This audit is not full demo acceptance or student-benefit evidence.
- Changed: AI logs only. Follow-up priorities remain in todo.md; no automatic merge, AI integration, data correction or remote publication.
### 2026-10-25 - Design backend beyond a single discovery task

- Result: Coordinator authored work/2026-10-25-backend-design/{design.md,summary.md,examples.json} from actual requirements, Rust/API/DB/client and public-content source inspection. Proposal keeps modular Rust monolith and existing contract generation; separates stable objects/participation paths/offering revisions, capture/statement/analysis evidence, provider/reader/interpreter ports and bounded execution. Includes source-restricted discovery compatibility, reversible identity decisions/legacy keys, local topic privacy, staged API/storage evolution and backend delivery order.
- Evidence: Current domain/db are largely boundaries and historical community schema, discovery is academic-public-HTML-specific, and most curated comparison/content remains in Web. No claim of a mature advisor backend requiring full replacement. Read PostgreSQL16 JSON/constraints and Tokio shutdown official docs; design inference distinguished from current behavior.
- Verification: Nine synthetic objects, one offering, three captures/statements, five extension cases and two execution cases structurally checked for reference/revision integrity, evidence excerpts, legacy namespaces and fixture cancellation generation; no errors. Source/product/API/tool SHA256 baseline unchanged. Relative links/fences and git diff --check passed. These are design consistency checks, not runtime cancellation/privacy/migration or browser tests; no application CI repeated for a work-only draft.
- Bounds/follow-up: No runtime source/schema/API/dependency edits, no private records inspected/transmitted, no Kimi frontend rewrite, no PR #19 changes, no commit/push or new backend PR. Proposal review and one minimal implementation slice remain pending; design does not automatically replace formal architecture or authorize cloud topic storage.

### 2026-10-25 - Narrow PR #19 to frontend design discussion

- Result: At the user's correction, simplified PR #19 title/body and docs/product/frontend-pre-design/index.md to the sole purpose of discussing the product's frontend direction from final requirements. Removed coordinator analysis, known-issue list and prescribed review checklist from the reader-facing introduction. Kimi originals unchanged; frontend/backend implementation separate, no live integration required.
- Verification: Strict MkDocs build passed for updated review tree. Published index update at 5eaa2ffb0ea9b466704449f91c97645879786ae5; GitHub metadata confirms revised title/body/head. Existing PR remains open, no merge or additional message/reviewer request.

### 2026-10-25 - Publish original Kimi frontend pre-design as PR #19

- Result: Created and attached [PR #19](https://github.com/114August514/campus-lumen/pull/19), docs/kimi-frontend-design-review → main, head f8e15ec89cb87dc7beca70ef7b0f89816dc8a023. Seven documentation files only: four review pages, MkDocs navigation and narrow AI Log updates based on exact main 7fae667. Existing PR #18 and mixed local code/doc changes left out; no merge or individual review request.
- Authorship: Original Kimi design, summary and research text preserved, adding only required freshness lines. Coordinator separately authored review entry/questions and known inconsistencies; no layout/design conclusion rewritten. Design proposal is not an adopted requirement or implemented interface.
- Verification: Exact-base staged docs tree passed MkDocs 1.6.1 strict build; original-text round-trip comparison, seven-file blob comparison, reverse patch check and git diff --check passed. Fresh GitHub metadata confirms open/unmerged, mergeable and expected head/files; remote CI status unconfirmed because workflow-status connector transport failed. No remote CI pass claimed.
- Handoff: Artifacts and redacted metadata in ignored work/2026-10-25-kimi-design-review-pr/. Pending peer-review item links PR; review questions cover requirements, IA/UE, concrete page outcomes and backend targets. No runtime source, dependencies or frontend design edits by coordinator.

### 2026-10-25 - Kimi independent requirements-led product frontend pre-design

- Result: At the user's request for a fresh independent round, Kimi k3-256k/high authored design-draft.md, summary.md, research-notes.md and handoff.md in ignored work/2026-10-25-kimi-independent-product-design/. Covers five capability groups, proposed IA/page responsibilities, six task flows, concrete content samples, N01–N13 traceability and experience-derived backend capability targets. Design-only, frontend target not limited to current backend readiness.
- Independence: Raw user request preserved in brief; prior work designs/feedback/research leads and AI Log excluded. Tool audit shows no previous work reads, no post-draft design feedback and no coordinator edits to the four originals; original hashes saved. Formal task-design/Skill remain inherited context. Actual new external research read DeepTutor README; other references explicitly reuse existing requirement materials, not fresh product trials.
- Verification: Actual successful request metadata confirms only k3-256k/high (21 calls). Initial sandbox connection errors resolved using approved network access on the same task/deadline, no prior design output. Source/product/contract/tool baseline unchanged, no new files in scope; Kimi writes confined to task. git diff --check passed. Separate coordinator-notes.md preserves navigation count/entry inconsistency and requirement-versus-IA distinction, without rewriting Kimi conclusions. No code, dependency, service, browser acceptance or application CI claimed.
- Closure/follow-up: Normal CLI exit0, no child and free writer lock; STOP retained within original deadline. No new automation, commit or push. Original proposal remains for user review; no new navigation or backend storage decision adopted automatically. Semantic-alignment pending entry links these materials.

### 2026-10-25 - Kimi frontend-first reflection and research

- Result: Kimi k3-256k/high completed two rounds of reflection and primary-source MSW/Pact/Vite documentation research. Produced research.md, frontend-target.md, contracts-and-backlog.md, scenarios.json, summary.md and handoff.md under ignored work/2026-10-25-kimi-frontend-first/. Frontend target covers complete interactive flows and explicitly designated scenario data before live backend integration; fixed profiles are a first implementation, not the target ceiling.
- Handoff: Comparison assembly contract C1 and local activity pointer C3 are proposals; C2 catalog migration is optional/independent. Backend order prioritizes curated then question-dependent comparison. Local continuation does not require backend storage. Preserves generated-contract pipeline, privacy and live-versus-simulated distinction; no silent fallback from failed live service.
- Verification: Coordinator structurally checked 10 scenarios/12 discovery snapshots for current OpenAPI required fields/types/enums/date-time parsing with zero errors; fixtures include non-preset assembled comparison, cancellation late event and structured reopen seeds. Fresh SHA256/source-addition audit unchanged in original scope; actual request metadata confirms only k3-256k/high (50 calls), Write/Edit paths confined to task reports. Runtime audit and coordinator-review.md record scope. git diff --check passed. No scenario replay, browser trial, application CI, implementation or dependency change claimed.
- Closure: User requested low-battery pause after Kimi finished; resumed only final review/log handoff without another API call. STOP retained, child null, prior exit0 and writer lock free; original start/deadline preserved. No new automation, commit or push. Pending semantic-alignment item retains proposed implementation scope for discussion.

### 2026-10-25 - Kimi positioning-led frontend pre-design and renewed diagnosis

- Result: Kimi k3-256k/high authored pre-design.md, re-diagnosis.md, summary.md and handoff.md in ignored work/2026-10-25-kimi-positioning-ia/. Derived proposed page responsibilities, concept relationships, three concrete flows/content examples and alternatives from confirmed positioning/tasks. Recommends retaining five destinations with comparison and topic continuation centered on the current question; compares a workspace and three-destination alternative as design judgments, not proven navigation superiority.
- Renewed diagnosis: Prioritizes question/context continuity in comparison and saved exploration ahead of source/readability cleanup. Proposed next slice carries the problem through existing fixed-profile comparison, explicit public-query followup and saving; arbitrary-question comparison is a separate capability. Revisions distinguish saved/edited timestamps from research progress and propose additive minimal records where actual comparison recovery is required. No frontend implementation or accepted product-rule changes.
- Verification: Source/product/tool/constraint/AGENTS SHA256 baseline unchanged and no new files in those areas; Kimi writes confined to task reports. Actual model metadata confirms k3-256k/high; no fallback. Reused prior unchanged-baseline browser evidence, no new browser or OSS trial/CI claimed. git diff --check passed. Task closed with STOP/free writer lock within original deadline; no schedule, commit or push.
- Follow-up: Discuss proposed IA and implementation scope with user; pending semantic-alignment item links both reports. Coordinator supplied factual/capability consistency corrections only, not replacement navigation or frontend design.

### 2026-10-25 - Kimi page-by-page diagnosis (started October 24)

- Result: Kimi k3-256k/high authored diagnosis.md, summary.md and handoff.md under ignored work/2026-10-24-kimi-page-diagnosis/. Covered five main destinations, advisor detail, followup, topic creation/editing, global context and workbench. Findings prioritize content/evidence hierarchy, long entry lists, fixed comparison combinations, demonstration defaults and session progress continuity. Recommendations remain proposals; no frontend implementation requested or made.
- Evidence: Coordinator supplied 21 current DOM/screenshot pairs on a new port5190 origin with one explicitly synthetic topic; replaced lagging screenshots and supplied same-baseline prior narrow comparison image. Kimi actually invoked ReadMediaFile on12 distinct files, plus DOM/selected source. Coordinator checked source and returned incorrect homepage-search and screenshot-based claims for Kimi's report correction; search does cover both catalogs, while caveat text is omitted. No live external discovery or user private records used.
- Verification: SHA256 baseline comparison found no modified or new frontend/tool files; actual model metadata records k3-256k/high, aliases excluded as providers. Kimi writes confined to this task's reports/marker. Read-only review, so no application CI repeated. Artifacts include runtime-audit.json and browser-evidence.md; no commit/push or new automation. Diagnostic scope and unobserved dynamic discovery states recorded in handoff.
- Follow-up: Discuss the findings alongside the pending semantic-alignment draft, then choose a Kimi implementation slice. No proposed layout or new requirement adopted on the user's behalf.

### 2026-10-24 - Prepare semantic-alignment materials

- Result: At the user's request, assembled a review draft covering original reference meanings, exploration/topic/session/run/agent concepts, current implementation gaps, a concrete Jiang/Song comparison using existing public evidence, and outcome-focused Kimi handoff. Main synthesis: connect the exploration question, evidence, difference explanation and continuation; pair-table/list changes alone cover only part of that task.
- Location: ignored work/2026-10-24-semantic-alignment/alignment.md. Reused requirements-handoff.md, overview.md, advisor-task-design.md, current App/comparison source and the prior actual research/browser record. No new external research or private record inspection/transmission.
- Verification: Checked the draft's current-state statements against source (fixed comparison profiles, public query input, transient comparison selection, topic persistence) and existing evidence. git diff --check passed. Documentation-only task; no application tests repeated, frontend writes, new runner or UI prescription.
- Follow-up: Discuss the proposed semantic interpretation before further Kimi design; keep pending item in todo.md. No new requirements accepted on the user's behalf.

### 2026-10-24 - Kimi paired comparison and exploration sessions

- Result: Following the user's Qwen paired-output and agent-session references, Kimi k3-256k/high researched actual DeepTutor session components and supplemental OpenHarness terminal source. Qwen compare UI was inaccessible; the pattern is based on the user's description, not an observed official screen. Kimi owned design and every frontend edit; coordinator supplied direction, verification and reproduced bugs only.
- Changed: AdvisorComparison now aligns candidate answers under shared question rows on desktop and repeats identity per question on narrow screens. App/ExploreHome and new TopicSessionItem organize saved explorations by recent activity with question/count/dates and a separate last-topic pointer; old storage schema/private records remain. Added 9 meaningful tests and updated advisor-task-design.md §8.7/ui-system.md. No dependency or API change.
- Repair/verification: Browser found unnamed Primer DataTable, explicit-no-topic restoring an unrelated topic, and date metadata swallowed by duplicate Description slots; Kimi repaired all three and actual browser retests passed. Independent scripts/ci/frontend.sh passed (95 web +17 API-client tests, typecheck/lint/style/build), docs check passed, 15 Kimi workflow tests passed and git diff --check passed. Actual desktop/390px, keyboard/theme, source disclosures, perspective/followup/return/remove and synthetic A/B isolation/conditions/reload checks passed; workbench desktop/new narrow frame observed. No captured console errors. Screenshots inspected; task artifacts/runtime audit in ignored work/2026-10-24-kimi-compare-sessions/. Final preview port 5180.
- Bounds/limits: Task closed within its original deadline with no active Kimi writer or new schedule; no commit/push. Existing ~860kB JS warning remains. OSS source review is not runtime trial; no live external discovery, full accessibility, student benefit or full demo acceptance claimed. Session-like organization does not imply executing background agents. Old mixed local work preserved.

### 2026-10-24 - Kimi-led open-source research and IA/UE/UI design

- Result: User requested reverting to `k3-256k`, independent open-source research and project-fitting IA/UE/UI, with Skills selected per scenario. Authenticated model metadata and real CLI requests confirm k3-256k/high (262144 context); fresh session, no fallback. Kimi chose CSRankings, Zotero Web Library and Linkwarden and actually read public README/HTML/selected JS, distinguishing source inference from runtime trial. No upstream installation/scripts or private records sent.
- Kimi design/implementation: Recorded overall five-destination IA, flows, reasons to retain structures, UI principles and implementation subset. Renamed first nav to 首页, made homepage a four-candidate preview with a full-list entry, and exposed source counts/collection dates on candidate rows. Browser found retained internship filtering behind “查看全部10项”; Kimi repaired it, then browser retest passed. Preserved public data, storage/API contracts, existing comparison/discovery/topic features and real-component workbench. Only App.tsx, ExploreHome.tsx and lib/advisors.ts changed in this task's frontend delta; no dependencies/style exceptions.
- Workflow/docs: Kimi updated its Skill/designer to support research-led IA reorganization and selective vendor reading, with no prescribed layouts or mandatory vendor/MCP use. Stable rationale and source references are in ui-system.md; ignored work retains review detail. Coordinator changed model config, collaboration instruction, factual status wording and bookkeeping only; no coordinator frontend code/design. Final task is closed within its original window; no new automation, commit or push.
- Verification: Fresh root `bun run ci:frontend` passed (86 web + 17 API-client tests, typecheck/lint/style/build); `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs`, 15 workflow tests and `git diff --check` passed. Actual desktop/390px checks covered preview/search/full-list recovery, keyboard focus/Enter, narrow nav, comparison, synthetic save/reload/continue-topic, theme switching and workbench parity; no horizontal overflow or captured console errors. Kimi actually used ReadMediaFile on one public reproduction screenshot; coordinator inspected final saved images. Runtime audit/artifacts: ignored `work/2026-10-24-kimi-research-design/`; public preview port 5178.
- Limits: Most overall structure remains by Kimi's choice; four-row preview is a hypothesis. No user-benefit validation, external OSS runtime trial, full accessibility or live discovery/cancellation test in this iteration. Existing large-bundle warning remains. Initial frame/scaled screenshot captures excluded from final evidence; final images checked. No claim of user design acceptance or full demo acceptance.

### 2026-10-24 - Continue Kimi frontend refinement with K3.1 Pro Highspeed

- Result: Authenticated official model directory confirmed `k3.1-pro-highspeed` (efforts low/high/max, no xhigh). Set high in the isolated Kimi-only profile and verified actual request model/effort plus real Better Design guide retrieval. Coordinator updated config-derived state and explicit UTC/Shanghai deadline context; no fallback or new unattended schedule.
- Kimi implementation: Added opportunity-filter reset/empty recovery and status/h2 semantics, useful empty-topic browsing actions, candidate institution context, and stale-success clearing on navigation. Repaired browser-reported nested main using Primer's supported `as` prop. Kimi updated future-session ReadMediaFile guidance; the bound session lacked that tool and claimed no screenshot inspection. Preserved PR #15/Primer, existing data, storage/API contracts, privacy and workbench. Source delta is three components plus two focused test files; existing mixed work remains uncommitted.
- Verification: Final Kimi `bun run ci:frontend` passed (86 web + 17 API-client tests, typecheck/lint/style/build); docs build, 15 workflow tests and `git diff --check` passed. Actual browser review covered desktop/390px filter reset via keyboard, visible focus, light/dark, both empty-topic routes, advisor/intern institution context, saved synthetic candidate/private-reason restoration after reload, workbench 390px parity and no console errors. Final source renders one main landmark and no horizontal overflow. Artifacts and original deadline are under ignored `work/2026-10-24-kimi-ui/`.
- Limits: Existing >500 kB bundle warning remains. Screen-reader audio, simulated storage failures and live external discovery were not executed in this iteration. One repair launch failed network connection, then resumed the same session/model within the unchanged deadline. Final task is closed after browser review; local preview is on port 5176. No commit, push or complete product acceptance claimed.

### 2026-10-23 - Connect the user-approved Better Design MCP to Kimi

- Result: After user sign-in and explicit confirmation, created the named project service key in the official site and saved it outside the repository with 0600 permissions; temporary handoff removed, no key printed or recorded in task artifacts. Installed reviewed official npm Better Design 0.48.0 into a separate local runtime with install scripts disabled. No account creation, checkout, terms acceptance, installer hooks or global editor configuration changes performed by the agent.
- Integration: `tools/kimi/better_design_mcp.py` exposes only public UI principles, UX principles and review rules from the official server's 48-tool inventory. It rejects other tools/query inputs, strips context locally before forwarding, disables optional call logging, and scopes the credential to its service child. Maintained launcher now writes a secret-free isolated MCP profile for frontend runs, with a separate `mcp-probe` action. Kimi updated its own Skill/designer instructions; PR #15/Primer and Kimi-only model execution remain.
- Verification: Real Kimi CLI 2.3.1 tool invocation returned `Topic: hierarchy` from the official service, both in the initial connection test and through the maintained entry after compatibility repair. Two earlier integrated runs produced success text without actual calls and were rejected; probe validation now requires matching tool-call/result evidence. Final compatibility probe passed without resetting earlier deadlines. Fourteen offline boundary/privacy/evidence tests, project Skill validation, `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs` and `git diff --check` passed. Credential scan found zero exact values in project artifacts.
- Limits: Verified public guideline retrieval and three-tool filtering, not code-upload review, component installation, generation, paid tools or a visual acceptance result. No frontend source/dependency changes in this connection task; no new autonomous design run or schedule. Initial anonymous HTTP access failure remains distinct from successful authenticated official-client access.

### 2026-10-23 - Verify user-assisted Better Design sign-in

- Result: After the user reported login complete, fresh browser inspection showed authenticated Dashboard/account navigation. Opened the official MCP page and observed key management with no API keys. Prepared the project key-name field only; did not create a credential, accept terms, initiate checkout or report MCP connectivity as successful. No authentication screenshot or credential recorded. Persistent key creation/use awaits the browser policy's action-time confirmation.

### 2026-10-23 - Verify the Better Design MCP connection requirements

- Result: Inspected the upstream README/Skill plus the official npm `better-design` 0.48.0 tarball and verified its registry SHA-1. Local stdio uses a cloud HTTP provider; documented setup can provision a limited free key without an account, stores a machine key and configures clients. This corrects any implication that downloading the Skill enables an offline design service or that Kimi lacks MCP support.
- Actual check: Anonymous JSON-RPC initialize to the documented official endpoint returned HTTP 403/Cloudflare 1010 `browser_signature_banned`, before authentication. No tool list or guide read succeeded; no project code/private data sent. Service key absent from the current environment. Installer/provisioning/terms acceptance/global configuration were not executed, and the access refusal was not bypassed.
- Handoff: Updated `tools/kimi/SOURCES.md`; ignored package/handshake artifacts are under `work/2026-10-23-better-design-mcp/`. Actual connection remains pending in todo.md. No frontend/model configuration changes.

### 2026-10-23 - Install reviewed design Skills and a reusable Kimi frontend workflow

- Result: Checked all ten user-supplied public GitHub repositories and complete file inventories. Three contain relevant Skills; seven are component/effect catalogs. Downloaded 67 selected text files with Git blob checksum verification under ignored `work/2026-10-23-design-skills/`. Preserved seven installed Skill directories verbatim using the official skill-installer helper, each with its MIT notice, plus seven catalog README/package/license snapshots. Exact revisions and hashes are in `tools/kimi/sources.lock.json`; classification, license exceptions and service limits are in `tools/kimi/SOURCES.md`.
- Integration: Kimi API authored `tools/kimi/skills/campus-frontend/SKILL.md` and `designer.md`, reconciling vendor typography/marketing advice with PR #15/Primer and honest evidence boundaries. Coordinator authored only orchestration/docs/tests: explicit project-local Skill loading, one Kimi endpoint/model with environment-only key reference, original-deadline preservation, a shared inherited writer lock, task STOP and redacted logs. AGENTS/tools/quality docs record the maintained invocation. No frontend source/dependency changes in this task, no global Skill installation, commit, push, schedule or new autonomous design budget.
- Verification: Actual official-CLI 2.3.1 Kimi API probe passed; transcript contains exactly three Read calls for the project Skill, accessibility and UX-copy references, with no writes. Bootstrap recorded two Write calls and one subsequent Edit to the Kimi agent prompt. Eight offline orchestration boundary tests passed; skill-creator `quick_validate.py` passed for the project Skill; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs` and `git diff --check` passed. All seven installed SKILL.md files matched pinned downloads; credential scan found zero exact key matches. A separate read-only stop trial ended with status stopped; no live workflow remains.
- Limits: Superdesign is downloaded but its cloud canvas/login/model path is not enabled; Better Design MCP is not connected or executed. Catalog implementations are not installed or adopted; Canvas UI has Commons Clause restrictions, Hyperiux separates MIT tooling/MPL free effects/proprietary Pro, and Motion Primitives/Cursify need license clarification before code reuse. Kimi cannot inspect screenshots in this CLI profile; coordinator browser feedback remains required. This is verified setup/loading, not measured design-quality improvement or a new page redesign. CLI discovery uses PATH/KIMI_BIN; the earlier executable remains in ignored work until separately installed durably.

### 2026-10-23 - Finish the bounded autonomous Kimi frontend session

- Result: Kimi completed four sequential rounds from 18:48:29 to 19:21:49 Asia/Shanghai (about 33 minutes), then declared readiness early. This was a 150-minute upper bound, not 2.5 hours of continuous work. All 132 audited model requests used `k3-256k`; no coordinator-authored frontend patches.
- Changed: Home/header hierarchy, advisor/scene navigation, comparison actions, topic creation and saved-result return paths, discovery headings/details and responsive panes. Current data/API/storage/privacy behavior and the isolated workbench remain. Detailed handoff and final logs are under ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-autonomous-ui/`.
- Verification: Final `bun run ci:frontend` passed typecheck, lint, UI checks, 17 API-client and 84 Web tests, and production build; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs` and `git diff --check` passed. Existing large-bundle warning remains. Fresh browser review checked home → advisor, internship scene selection, synthetic topic creation/save, saved-result return, comparison presets, and equal client/scroll widths at desktop and 390px. Screenshots: `review-home-desktop.jpg`, `review-compare-narrow.jpg` in that task folder.
- Limits: Browser review was delayed by the platform usage/automatic-review limit, then resumed after recovery. No fresh live external discovery, comprehensive accessibility audit or user-benefit validation claimed. Changes remain local. Runner had already exited; stop marker set and heartbeat `kimi-2-5` deleted after review, without resetting the original deadline.

### 2026-10-23 - Launch the bounded autonomous Kimi design session

- Result: User authorized roughly 2–3 hours of autonomous frontend refinement with Kimi design ownership. Started the isolated official-CLI supervisor at 18:48:29 Asia/Shanghai; hard final deadline 21:18:29. First real Kimi tool calls and live state updates observed, not merely a scheduled prompt.
- Orchestration: App heartbeat `kimi-2-5` follows the current chat every 10 minutes, with at most 18 checks; it verifies progress, preserves the original budget, performs final browser review and removes itself at completion/failure/stop. Supervisor allows only one sequential Kimi writer, up to 135 minutes of design plus 15 minutes of checks, with early readiness and three-failure stop. Kimi-only config references the existing environment key; no credentials stored.
- Verification: `kimi doctor` validated the profile; `python3 -m py_compile .../runner.py` passed; checked live `state.json` and `round-01.jsonl`, plus automation view. Baseline tracked diff and Web sources/tests were backed up to the ignored task folder before launch. No frontend changes authored by the coordinator for this setup.
- Follow-up: This records successful setup/start only. Frontend design, checks and browser acceptance remain in todo.md until execution and review finish. Local execution depends on the computer/app remaining available; user can request stopping in this chat.

### 2026-10-23 - Kimi continues the PR #15 frontend design

- Result: User chose PR #15 (`1a3a9c6`) as the visual starting point and gave Kimi design ownership. Kimi implemented the open-compass header/favicon, icon navigation with mobile menu, persistent Primer day/night switching, large search and main/sidebar home layout, recent-topic entry and explanatory footer, using the current Campus Lumen name. Coordinator supplied the original source, functional boundaries and verification only; no coordinator-authored frontend patches or replacement layout instructions.
- Changed: `apps/web/index.html`, `src/app/App.tsx`, `components/ExploreHome.tsx`, `main.tsx`, shared `ThemeRoot.tsx`, original SVG under `src/assets/`, declarative `app/theme.css`, Vite types and UI checker. Kimi updated ui-system, frontend-reference, quality and development docs; AGENTS now records the selected visual baseline, Kimi ownership and the accepted theme mapping. Existing component workbench remains usable.
- Preserved: Current exploration-store schema/key, public collected data, comparison/follow-up, TopicEditor, discovery/run isolation and API contract were not replaced with PR #15's earlier implementations. No backend, dependency or model-inference integration change. Production output has only index.html; workbench remains a dev entry. Original source and pre-existing uncommitted work were backed up under ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-pr15-design/` before edits.
- Verification: Kimi's checks and coordinator's final `bun run ci:frontend` passed: 17 API-client and 84 Web tests, typecheck, lint, UI checks and production build. `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs` and `git diff --check` passed. Existing bundle-size warning remains (about 855 kB). Local request audit recorded 45 calls using only `k3-256k` through the isolated Kimi endpoint profile; no credential matches found in task config/text/log artifacts. Final preview console had no errors.
- Browser: Isolated local test origin used only synthetic topic/reason content. Checked header/logo and embedded SVG favicon; day/night changed actual document and text colors; created a synthetic topic, saved Jiang, edited topic conditions and reopened the saved reason after reopening the page; mobile menu navigated into two-advisor comparison; home empty-search action carried the query into discovery without submitting it. Home, saved and comparison views had matching document client/scroll widths at 390px (375 with scrollbar). Keyboard Tab reached the appearance control. Workbench loaded the new home in its narrow iframe. Screenshots are local under the task work directory.
- Limits: Visual/interaction integration, not a blanket reset to the old branch or full demo acceptance. Current view-state navigation remains; PR #15's hash router, early API/storage and single-file export were not restored. No fresh live external-source discovery run or full accessibility assessment claimed. Changes remain local, not committed/pushed; subsequent visual iteration should continue through Kimi from this baseline.

### 2026-10-23 - Locate the missing product icon in the unmerged prototype

- Result: Screenshot matches the open-compass SVG and header/favicon integration in commit `1a3a9c6`, retained on `origin/feat/web-opportunity-prototype`. Fresh GitHub reads of PR #15 confirm closed, `merged=false`; its closure comment says to retain the branch and port missing capabilities separately. Main's PR #16 integrated the opportunity features, with logo/theme/export deferred in the existing October 15 handoff. The logo was never integrated into the current main lineage, rather than removed by recent Kimi edits.
- Evidence: `git branch -a --contains 1a3a9c6`, `git log HEAD -- apps/web/src/assets/campus-agora-mark.svg docs/assets/brand`, old/current index.html and App.tsx, plus `git diff HEAD` for the Kimi changes. Current index has no favicon link and header contains only Campus Lumen text. Retrieved original PNG/SVG/design notes byte-for-byte into ignored `work/2026-10-23-logo-history/` for inspection; source assets remain recoverable from Git.
- Scope: Investigation and handoff only, no frontend source changes, no branch switching, merge or push. Existing in-progress workbench edits preserved. Track targeted branding integration separately; do not restore the duplicate old frontend or infer approval for dark mode.

### 2026-10-23 - Kimi-authored component and live-preview workbench

- Result: Official Kimi CLI authored all frontend changes through `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1`, model `k3-256k`. An isolated single-provider profile had no model fallback; the local session audit recorded 47 requests using only that model. Coordinator relayed constraints, reviewed changes and verified the browser. Kimi-only frontend execution is now recorded in AGENTS.md.
- Changed: Dev-only `apps/web/workbench.html`, `workbench-preview.html` and `src/workbench/` reuse ExploreHome, AdvisorDetail and AdvisorComparison; extracted AdvisorDetail without behavior changes and shared one `components/ui/ThemeRoot.tsx` across all three entries. Development documentation records access, HMR and state boundaries. No new dependencies or backend changes.
- Isolation: Preview saves use the real store with an in-memory backend and a separate key, never product localStorage. Discovery is excluded. Production build contains only index.html and no workbench entry. Extracted official Kimi UI guidance remains reference material, not a portable installed frontend Skill or Work-service dependency.
- Verification: Kimi ran `bun run ci:frontend` successfully after browser-directed fixes. Coordinator repeated it against the final sources: 17 API-client tests, 84 Web tests, typecheck, lint, UI-pattern checks and production build passed. `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs` and `git diff --check` passed. Existing large-bundle warning remains. Also checked the unique theme declaration, Kimi-only request audit and zero credential matches in task text/config/log artifacts; final browser console had no errors.
- Browser: All three previews rendered; detail saving showed in-memory feedback and added no preview topic to the product selector. Comparison perspective/pair changes worked. iframe clientWidth was corrected from 386 to 390; comparison content had equal client/scroll widths (375 with scrollbar). Selection changed through messages without changing iframe src; stale save feedback cleared; keyboard Tab reached the next control. Vite applied code updates without manual reload. Screenshot and non-sensitive Kimi execution artifacts are in ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-frontend-workbench/`.
- Limits: This is the first local development workbench, not a visual redesign, a drag-and-drop editor, completed product acceptance or integrated in-product Kimi inference. Switching desktop/narrow remounts preview state; HTML frameBorder removes the default frame border within the no-custom-CSS rule. Kimi CLI remains installed only under ignored work; no global CLI/Skill installation claimed. Changes are local, not committed/pushed.

### 2026-10-23 - Execute Kimi Blueprint and official CLI connectivity experiments

- Result: Under the user's explicit test request, launched extracted official `@kimi/daimon` 0.6.10 from Kimi Work 3.2.19 with Node 24.22.1 and fresh isolated state. Its advertised local control interface supports Widget/Canvas/Automation/Binding list operations. Real control calls created, updated and validated a synthetic HTML Widget, created a Canvas and placed/read back the Widget layout, created a manual Python Automation, and created a Binding with `pending_run` validation. No proprietary service behavior was mocked.
- Boundaries: `Widget.show` failed with `no_surface_context`; neither Kimi-hosted rendering nor desktop interaction is verified. The manual constant Python run failed with `Python runtime child process did not expose a PID`; isolated managed Python artifacts are missing, and no successful artifact/delivery is claimed. Blueprint describes the connecting workflow, not a separate rendering tool.
- Official CLI: Reviewed the official installer from `https://code.kimi.com/kimi-code/install.sh`, then installed/checksummed Kimi Code CLI 2.3.1 under ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-blueprint-probe/official-cli/`, with isolated `KIMI_CODE_HOME` and no PATH/shell-profile change. Config validation passed. A locally authored temporary read-only MCP bridge connected it to the extracted control service. The actual model called all four MCP tools exactly once; each returned a count of one, and CLI returned `BLUEPRINT_CLI_PROBE automation=1 binding=1 canvas=1 widget=1`. This is evidence of the experimental bridge, not official default integration or model-driven write access.
- Isolation: Used only synthetic fixtures, manual triggers and no delivery targets. The model received only a test prompt/tool summaries, not repository/private-topic content. Key referenced by environment-variable name; artifact scan found no exact credential value. Control tokens were redacted before output; no control-token log is stored. No schedules, login, global daemon or production dependency added; post-run process inspection found no remaining experiment runtime.
- Evidence/checks: Ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-blueprint-probe/verification-report.md`, `verification-summary.json`, `control-results.json`, `cli-probe.jsonl` and `mcp-probe-audit.jsonl`. Verified four real CLI tool responses and `pending_run` versus completed delivery. `node --check` for both temporary probes and `git diff --check` passed. Initial sandbox transport attempts failed; the approved local-listener retry enabled real fd-RPC/loopback testing. No frontend checks rerun because product code was not changed.

### 2026-10-23 - Inventory packaged Kimi skills and assess local reuse

- Result: Enumerated 46 explicit `SKILL.md` files in the inspected 3.2.19 package: 22 in direct desktop/kernel/companion resources and 24 in dependency packages (OpenClaw and dotenv). This count includes helper rules and same-named host-specific definitions, not 46 independent Moonshot-authored or active skills. Continued through the browser bundle, whose `.zip` filename actually contains gzip/TAR; app.asar and npm.asar indexes contained no matching definitions.
- Deliverable: Ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-skill-inspection/skill-inventory.md` and `.json` list every definition's origin, purpose, applicability, path and SHA256. Read metadata across all definitions and examined relevant tool/runtime prerequisites. Primary local commands `gh`, `tmux`, `ffmpeg` and `jq` exist; `kimi-slides`, `kimi-daimon`, `kimiim-cli`, `clawhub` and `codexbar` were not found on PATH. No external account or daemon availability was inferred.
- Assessment: `kimi-design` UI guidance is useful as a reference under project Primer rules. `widgetdesign` host styles/runtime are not a replacement. `pptx-surgical` is a portable candidate for bounded existing-PPTX text changes, pending synthetic execution validation; research/skill-authoring methods can be read selectively. Most remaining entries require Kimi/OpenClaw services or are unrelated to the active product. No installation, activation, new product requirement, full frontend skill, script execution or service integration is claimed.
- Verification: Checked 46 original paths/hashes, exact 22/24 partition, archive index parsing and nested archive listing; `git diff --check`. The pending installation decision remains separate in todo.md.

### 2026-10-23 - Inspect skills bundled in the official Kimi Work desktop installer

- Source: User proposed obtaining official skills from the app installation contents. Followed the Windows link on `https://www.kimi.com/products/download` to the official `https://kimi-img.moonshot.cn/app/download/windows/kimi_3.2.19.exe` package. Downloaded 423308160 bytes; SHA256 `552de9597ceecf7f85c30b19d38f6ae2014b27e340319756a4d9b2a36e483334`.
- Result: Used the official 7-Zip Linux utility in `/tmp` to statically extract the installer payload and inspect app/gateway ASAR indexes and the daimon bundle TAR inventory. Found actual built-in skills, including `kimi-design`, `widgetdesign`, `widget`, `blueprint`, and `canvas`; extracted these five directories (146 files) with file hashes and source metadata in ignored `work/2026-10-23-kimi-skill-inspection/provenance.json`. No installer, app, packaged script, or authentication flow was run.
- Applicability: `kimi-design` explicitly targets editable PPTD assets and its UI profile distinguishes static mockups from runnable apps; `widgetdesign` requires Kimi host CSS/runtime and differs from this project's Primer stack. No `webapp-building` path was found in the inspected installer/app/gateway/daimon inventories. Extraction confirms official package provenance, not portability, complete tooling, or a reusable license grant. No global skill installation or frontend implementation is claimed.
- Verification: Installer size matched the official response metadata; archive extraction succeeded, both ASAR JSON headers were parsed, extracted skill definitions and UI profile were read, and `git diff --check` passed. Installation suitability remains in todo.md.

### 2026-10-23 - Verify Kimi access and frontend skill provenance

- Result: OMP's configured `kimi-code/k3-256k` returned `KIMI_CONNECTION_OK` in an ephemeral, tool-disabled test outside the project. The earlier Moonshot general API test returned HTTP 401; that result does not invalidate the separate Kimi Code endpoint.
- Investigation: Local OMP designer model mapping exists, but the running binary's exported bundled agents omit designer; adjacent package source includes a designer prompt and has a different version. OMP reports no installed plugins. `omp-designer` is maintained by LePro10, not MoonshotAI or the OMP main project.
- Skill source: Read the official Kimi Build/Code Skills documentation and inspected the public MoonshotAI/kimi-code tree. Found the internal `webapp-building` description, but no official downloadable frontend skill. Supplementary official-repository API reads hit rate limits. No community copy was installed as official, and no frontend implementation was changed. Pending installation and the user's preference to use Kimi for frontend design are recorded in todo.md.
- Verification: `omp agents unpack --dir /tmp/campus-lumen-omp-agent-inspection --json`, `omp plugin list`, the minimal OMP request, and public repository metadata reads. No credentials or private topic records were included in the model test or logs. `git diff --check` checks this log update.

### 2026-10-22 - Implement topic conditions and bounded cancellable discovery

- Result: Following merged PR #17, continued `feat/topic-edit-and-bounded-discovery`. Added Primer topic editing with explicit save, unsaved-close choices/reload warning and retained drafts on failed saves. Conditions preserve candidates, source snapshots, private notes/questions and the other topic, and are never automatically sent as public queries.
- Runtime: Added cumulative NDJSON snapshots to the existing discovery endpoint, with the original JSON path retained. Completed sources arrive before the run finishes. Server deadline is 30s, at most five source pages/six logical reads; existing 14s/1MB read bounds and four HTTP attempts imply at most 48 external HTTP requests including fixed DNS fallback. Browser waits at most 35s. Abort invalidates the run before cancelling; response-body drop aborts its worker/JoinSet and releases admission. No automatic retry/model calls. Added only a direct dependency on the already locked `futures-core` for the HTTP stream trait.
- Verification: `bun run ci:frontend` passed lint/style/typechecks, 17 API-client + 72 Web tests and build (838kB bundle warning remains); `cargo test --workspace` passed 23 tests and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed. Contract export was regenerated, strict `bun run ci:docs` and `git diff --check` passed. Tests cover UTF-8 chunk boundaries, missing final markers, buffered data after abort, stale-run success/failure, deadlines, disposal, partial-source retention and permit release.
- Actual walkthrough: Browser tested two new synthetic topics, unsaved-close/continue/save/reload, isolation, repeat source saving and preservation of synthetic private records after condition edits. Keyword discovery encountered a verification page and showed limited-directory failure/no-match truthfully. Separate direct reading actually fetched `https://jzuming.github.io/`; the production client controller then ran a fresh real request and cancelled on its first body snapshot (`sources=1`, `finished=false`), preserving evidence and cancelled state. Browser also exercised mid-request cancellation and inspected the editor at 390px. Temporary scripts, sanitized result summary and public/synthetic screenshots are ignored under `work/2026-10-22-topic-and-bounded-discovery/`.
- Handoff: Owning contracts, backend/development/privacy docs, current product progress and AGENTS are updated. Rename/organization is isolated in prerequisite commit `51e81dd`. This slice is prepared for PR publication; no merge, student-benefit result, external-AI path, mistaken-merge repair or complete G5 acceptance is claimed.

### 2026-10-22 - Consolidate legacy sibling Git worktrees

- Result: Moved `campus-agora-advisor-prototype` to `campus-lumen/.worktrees/advisor-prototype` and `campus-agora-explore-focus` to `.worktrees/explore-focus` using `git worktree move`. Both held independent uncommitted files; preserved them and their branches instead of deleting or merging. The only remaining `campus-agora*` entry in Projects is the main checkout's compatibility symlink, still used by the current chat/saved project.
- Verification: Recorded pre-move fingerprints in ignored `work/2026-10-22-worktree-organization/`. Post-move checks matched root inodes, HEAD, branch, full Git status, staged/unstaged binary diff hashes and 145/138/138 source file hashes for main/prototype/focus respectively. `git worktree repair` fixed the nested Claude worktree registration; all four registered roots now use canonical campus-lumen paths. Strict `bun run ci:docs` with the local work cache and `git diff --check` passed; `git worktree prune --dry-run --verbose` proposed no removals. Source locations and disposition are documented in `docs/engineering/repository-layout.md`.
- Decisions: `.worktrees/` holds local branch checkouts; `work/` holds intermediate notes/output. No file content, branch or uncommitted work was deleted; no commit/push. Reuse/removal of the retained experimental work remains a later deliberate decision.

### 2026-10-22 - Rename local checkout directory

- Result: Moved the actual checkout to `/home/august/Projects/campus-lumen`. The old `/home/august/Projects/campus-agora` is a relative symlink to `campus-lumen`, preserving the current chat, saved project entry and existing local absolute paths without copying files. Updated the canonical-path guidance in `docs/engineering/repository-layout.md`.
- Verification: Before/after directory and `.git` inodes, HEAD, branch, complete Git status and origin matched. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and offline Cargo metadata report the new root. From the new directory, `bun run typecheck` and strict `bun run ci:docs` with the local work cache passed; existing process files remain present. `git diff --check` passed. Origin remains `git@github.com:114August514/campus-lumen.git`.
- Decisions: The saved Codex project still references the compatibility path; future project/terminal selections should use the canonical new path. Keep the link until those entries have migrated. No commit, push or file deletion.

### 2026-10-22 - Rename project and GitHub repository to Campus Lumen

- Result: Under explicit user authorization, renamed GitHub `114August514/campus-agora` to `114August514/campus-lumen` and set its description to “帮大学生跨机构发现科研、实习、竞赛、交流等机会，看懂实际任务与条件，自主决定下一步。” Repository ID remained `1290513122`. Updated local `origin` fetch/push URL to `git@github.com:114August514/campus-lumen.git`; `git ls-remote --symref origin HEAD` succeeded, resolving main at `7fae667dab18650b17a40e1b4f4a64094fd63d0d`.
- Changed: Current README/product/docs identity and repository links; root Bun/Cargo repository metadata; Web title/heading; Tauri display names; API metadata/OpenAPI title and regenerated snapshots; client mock/error messages and existing test expectations; discovery user-agent; MkDocs/uv project identity and lock metadata. Remote description no longer advertises the retired community product. No product scope expansion.
- Verification: `bun run ci:frontend` passed type/style/lint checks, 14 API-client and 65 Web tests, and production build (existing bundle-size warning retained). `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo test --workspace` passed 21 tests. Repeated `bun run api:types` preserved both generated file hashes; JSON assertions confirmed new display names and retained compatibility keys. `bun install --frozen-lockfile --offline`, strict `bun run ci:docs` with the local work cache, and `git diff --check` passed. GitHub PATCH and fresh GET confirmed name, description and stable ID.
- Decisions: Preserve `@campus-agora/*`, `campus_agora_*`, existing database/app identifiers and browser storage key to avoid unrelated data migrations. Keep historical records and the local checkout folder name; document naming compatibility in `docs/engineering/repository-layout.md`. GitHub rename/description and local remote are applied; local source/doc edits are not committed or pushed, including the prior folder-organization work.

### 2026-10-22 - Explain folder responsibilities and isolate intermediate work

- Result: Added `docs/engineering/repository-layout.md` and `work/README.md`; documented directory roles and a local `work/YYYY-MM-DD-task/` convention. Only the work guide is eligible for normal Git inclusion; drafts/output stay ignored. AGENTS and root/tool entry points now carry this rule; MkDocs includes the layout guide.
- Moved: `temp/temp1.md` → `work/legacy/notes/temp1.md`; untracked `tools/prototypes/opportunities.html` → `work/legacy/prototype/opportunities.html`. Both SHA-256 comparisons passed; removed the empty `temp/` directory and updated current preview/UI-reference paths. Reviewed text specimens, source paths and historical records were preserved.
- Verification: `git diff --check`; `git check-ignore -v` for moved and hypothetical process paths; Python checks for guide visibility and relative Markdown file targets; `UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD/work/2026-10-22-folder-organization/uv-cache" bun run ci:docs` passed the strict MkDocs build and historical-site exclusions. Initial sandbox attempts encountered a read-only cache and unavailable dependency downloads; the network-enabled retry installed locked dependencies and passed.
- Decisions: Keep AI Log to short pending/completed facts; promote accepted decisions, reusable tools and reviewed data into their maintained directories. Work files stay local and cannot be build or handoff dependencies. No runtime behavior changed; no commit or push.

### 2026-10-16 - Integrate authentic internship batch and multi-perspective comparison engine

- Result: Integrated authentic internship dataset (`apps/web/src/data/internship-batch-2026-10-16.json` covering Shanghai AI Lab and MSRA system/eval roles) with the multi-type opportunities architecture on `main`. Extended candidate snapshots and parsing with candidate `type`, `title`, `description`, `metadata`. Built a dedicated source-bound internship comparison engine with role-specific perspectives (`role` 业务职责与课题, `growth` 转正与成长途径, `practical` 时间地点与要求) and technical focus options (`systems` 大规模分布式系统, `evaluation` 大模型评测与对齐). Added candidate scenario switcher (`全部` / `选导师` / `找实习`) and quick-switch comparison actions in both Explore and Compare views.
- Changed:
  - `apps/web/src/data/internship-batch-2026-10-16.json`: authentic 2026-10-16 partial batch with Shanghai AI Lab and MSRA positions.
  - `apps/web/src/lib/collected-batch.ts`: accept `opportunities` array and candidate `type`, `title`, `description`, `metadata`.
  - `apps/web/src/lib/exploration-store.ts`: CandidateSnapshot extended with type and metadata; cloning and persistence preserve these attributes.
  - `apps/web/src/lib/advisors.ts`: exports `internships`, `allOpportunities`, `allBatches`.
  - `apps/web/src/lib/advisor-comparison.ts`: added `InternshipPerspective`, `InternshipFocus`, unified `AnyComparisonPerspective`, `AnyComparisonFocus`, internship profiles and comparison builders.
  - `apps/web/src/lib/comparison-followup.ts`: supports `AnyComparisonPerspective` for query seeding.
  - `apps/web/src/lib/opportunities.ts`: appended authentic internship positions to opportunities list and added scenario definitions (`SCENARIOS`, `getScenario`).
  - `apps/web/src/components/AdvisorComparison.tsx`: dynamically renders internship comparison tables, controls, and focus hints.
  - `apps/web/src/components/DiscoveryPanel.tsx`: scenario-aware placeholders and candidate list.
  - `apps/web/src/components/ExploreHome.tsx`: candidate section heading updated to "导师与岗位候选".
  - `apps/web/src/app/App.tsx`: scenario switcher segmented controls, comparison quick-switch buttons, candidate type badges, and contextual detail labels.
  - `apps/web/tests/internship-comparison.test.ts`: test suite for internship comparison engine.
  - `apps/web/tests/exploration-store.test.ts`: tests for candidate snapshots with type/metadata.
  - `apps/web/tests/opportunities.test.ts`: tests for scenario fallback and opportunity items.
- Verification:
  - `bun run discovery:validate apps/web/src/data/internship-batch-2026-10-16.json` (3 positions, 4 sources, partial batch validated).
  - `bun run ci:frontend` (65 tests pass across 8 test suites, TypeScript typecheck, Biome linting, Vite production build).
  - `cargo test --workspace` (20 tests passed).
  - `git diff --check` passed with 0 errors.
- Follow-up: Changes are verified on branch `feat/integrate-internship-comparison` ready for review or PR.

### 2026-10-16 - Review and squash merge PR #16

- Result: At the user's request, reviewed and squash merged [PR #16](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/16) into main as 16767aa24d308e727d176aa48bc85300e5726bf6. Fresh GitHub reads confirm MERGED and the main ref points to this commit. The merge request matched the reviewed head 8bad5da6144dfd49d65cfa398d9866cbc9610e73.
- Review: Focused independent review confirmed multi-type opportunity browsing (23 sourced opportunities across 8 categories), exploration home entry search, type-based filtering with ended-batch historical indicators, backward-compatible topic opportunity persistence with isolated private reasons/questions, and strict Primer component/layout compliance. No blocking issue or UI rule violation found.
- Verification: CI run 38596754235 belongs to the exact PR head; frontend, backend, desktop, contract, docs, and container all succeeded. Fresh local `bun run ci:frontend` (59 tests across 7 files, typecheck, Biome lint, Vite build), `cargo test --workspace` (20 tests), and `git diff --check` passed.
- Local integration: Fetched origin/main, confirmed old local main was its ancestor, then moved local main to 16767aa via fast-forward. Existing feature branches (including feat/internship-deep-comparison) and untracked tools/prototypes/opportunities.html were preserved.
- Handoff: Merge-record updates to AI logs remain local. Next: integrate the internship deep comparison and authentic batch from feat/internship-deep-comparison on top of the newly expanded multi-type base.

### 2026-10-15 - Extend the Web beyond advisors: multi-type entries and saved opportunities

- Source: User corrected that the product is not only advisor search (requirements v1.0 §2.1, §6.2: other types offer lightweight entry/condition lookups). Rebuilt on main after closing the duplicate PR #15.
- Result: Header renamed Campus Agora; new default 探索 view searches advisors plus 23 sourced opportunities/resources/rules and browses 8 types; 机会与入口 filters by type and can hide ended batches (labelled 历史参考, never shown as open); topics can save opportunities with per-topic private reasons/questions. Existing 找导师/比较/补查 flows unchanged.
- Changed: apps/web/src/lib/opportunities.ts (data from docs/constraints/opportunity-needs-map.md and earlier notes); lib/exploration-store.ts (optional `opportunities` on version-1 topics, validation, save/update/remove); components/ExploreHome.tsx, OpportunityBrowser.tsx; app/App.tsx; index.html; tests/opportunities.test.ts and new store tests.
- Verification: `bun test tests/*.test.ts tests/*.test.tsx` 59 pass (AppleDouble `._*` files on the external drive must be excluded from the glob); typecheck, Biome, `lint:styles`, build pass; browser at 1280px/375px: cross-type search, type jump, topic save, reason edit and reload restore, no console errors after fixing an ActionList.GroupHeading crash.
- Follow-up: Logo, light/dark switching and the single-file export were built in a parallel session on the closed branch and conflict with main's fixed-light rule and no-CSS check; port them separately once that work settles. Comparison and public lookup still cover advisors only.

### 2026-10-12 - Complete candidate-specific direct reading and comparison follow-up

- Result: Reused committed navigation/follow-up at 7094fa4, added a choice of previously collected academic pages and direct public HTML reading. URL requests use provider direct_url, bypass search, and never substitute directory/demo results on failure. Existing public-address/redirect/size/time limits remain. The query is the only request field; private reasons/questions are not attached automatically. Social/browser sources retain their existing reading path.
- Browser evidence: From Jiang's comparison, selected https://jzuming.github.io/ and actually obtained his HKU identity, systems/security/databases and AI research, PhD/RA recruitment statement and recent work. Current places and detailed RA eligibility remain unknown. Saved the same result twice: one supplemental source remained. Returning retained the saved reason and synthetic unsaved draft; a second synthetic topic showed neither record nor source. Reload restored the first topic's source/body, capture date and originally saved records, not the unsaved draft. Existing topics were preserved; two clearly labeled demo topics remain. At 390px there was no document overflow, and Tab from the source menu reached the read button. No screenshots of private records were saved.
- Changed: application/API direct reading and tests, generated contract/client, DiscoveryPanel and its two presentation tests, follow-up help text, architecture/security/privacy/development docs, overview/milestones/task-design §8.5 and AI logs. No dependency, database, authentication or AI-provider change.
- Verification: bun run ci:frontend (14 client + 52 Web tests, types/lint/UI checks/build); cargo fmt --all --check; cargo clippy -p campus_agora_application -p campus_agora_api --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test -p campus_agora_application -p campus_agora_api (20 tests); bun run api:types; bun run ci:contract after committing generated snapshots; UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs; git diff --check. Independent read-only review found no actionable issues. No unrelated desktop/container/database checks repeated. Local Bun remains 1.4.2 versus pinned 1.3.14; existing roughly 787 kB / 195 kB gzip main-bundle warning remains.
- Integration: Fresh GitHub inspection confirmed [PR #13](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/13) already merged on October 8 as 258cc6962ece6ce2b4c863a7d3cac7a28f98fe46. Its main tree equals the former feature HEAD 7094fa4. Created feat/direct-source-read from fetched origin/main with the local changes intact; no rebase, history rewrite or direct main push.
- Handoff: Implementation commit 12107e7 published as [PR #14](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/14), feat/direct-source-read → main; attached to this chat, not merged. Local API/Web running at 8080/5173; public-only source-selection screenshot at /tmp/campus-agora-direct-read-20261012.png. Historical tools/prototypes/opportunities.html stays untracked. Local checks are distinct from current GitHub CI status. This verifies developer-operated workflow behavior, not student benefit, automated comparison conclusions, current recruitment or complete demo acceptance.
- Follow-up: Review/integrate PR #14, then take topic-condition editing and discovery control from todo.md. Preparation/contact/resources, mistaken-association repair and full demo checks remain open.

### 2026-10-08 - Walk comparison follow-up against a live public lookup

- Result: From the comparison of 江祖铭 and 宋卓然, follow-up prefilled a public query containing 江祖铭. Changing it to 机器学习 returned fetched page text with matching passages. Saving attached one source to the current topic (4 existing sources became 5) without a second candidate. Returning kept the unsaved question draft and the saved reason. Reload restored the supplemental source and the saved reason. A second topic showed no supplemental sources and did not change the first. A nonsense query did not save anything; the page showed the search challenge, the limited-directory fallback, and that no matching body was found.
- Changed: comparison follow-up behavior was already in the working tree; this entry records the live walk. UI navigation from 2026-10-07 remains in the same branch.
- Verification: Chromium on http://127.0.0.1:5173 with the local API. `bun test tests/comparison-followup.test.ts` passed earlier in the session. Fixed comparison sentence “数据库、操作系统、安全与软件工程” still renders, including at 390px with no horizontal overflow.
- Decisions: No model or provider change. Private notes stayed out of the query. Historical opportunities.html stays untracked.
- Follow-up: Open the branch PR. Topic-condition editing, cancellation limits, mistaken-association repair, and preparation entries remain open.

### 2026-10-07 - Tighten the advisor UI with Primer navigation and lists

- Result: On feat/comparison-followup, the explore page now uses UnderlineNav for 探索 / 比较 / 我的探索, ActionList for saved candidates, and Banner only for real lookup or save status. Follow-up keeps one return to comparison. No new visual system.
- Changed: apps/web/src/app/App.tsx, apps/web/src/components/DiscoveryPanel.tsx, docs/product/ui-system.md.
- Verification: bun --cwd apps/web typecheck, lint:styles, comparison-followup tests, and biome check passed. Chromium at 1280 and 390: nav, candidate selection, compare, saved page, overflow 0, Primer focus ring on the nav. Not committed.
- Decisions: Borrowed GitHub Primer navigation and row lists, plus the 107 density and status-color rule already in ui-system.md. Did not copy 107 cards, antd, green primary buttons, or Primer Brand comparison tables.
- Follow-up: The comparison follow-up slice is still uncommitted and has not had a live external lookup walk.

### 2026-10-06 - Review and squash merge PR #12

- Result: At the user's request, reviewed and squash merged [PR #12](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/12) into main as a8a0209eaa6a4003b59b0263e0f2048a74b94498. Fresh GitHub inspection confirms closed/merged and this merge SHA. No blocking issue found; no runtime change in this review.
- Review: Independent bounded code review confirmed topic-scoped private records, comparison draft clearing, source/time/batch binding, query-only external transfer and bounded public-page fetching. GitHub showed no submitted reviews or review threads. Existing declared follow-ups are not represented as complete.
- Verification: Re-read head c5bd897 and [CI run 37477321621](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/actions/runs/37477321621); frontend, backend, desktop, contract, docs and container all succeeded. git diff --check origin/main...HEAD passed before merge; the fetched squash commit has the same file tree as the reviewed head. Local merge-record edits passed UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check. No claim about post-merge main CI completion.
- Local integration: Fetched origin/main, preserved old divergent main feb4549 in backup/main-before-pr12-20261006, then moved and switched local main to a8a0209. Feature branch and original docs branch remain; untracked historical opportunities.html was preserved. No branch deletion, new issue, reviewer request or direct push to main.
- Follow-up: Updated todo.md and milestones.md with verified merge state. These merge-record edits remain local for the next documentation submission; do not mistake them for part of the merged PR. Continue the four proposed P2 outcome groups, with bundle-size optimization when extending the next slice.

### 2026-10-06 - Publish the discovery and choice-support implementation

- Result: Created and attached [PR #12](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/12), feat/advisor-discovery-workflow → main. The 63-file implementation includes live discovery/API/contract/client, Primer Web, isolated browser topics, source-bound comparison, two actual collection batches, discovery skill/validator, reuse research, tests and related docs/locks. Historical opportunities.html remains untracked and excluded; no issue creation or merge.
- Integration: Rebased only the new implementation commit onto latest main 01dc9a1; resolved eight documentation conflicts by retaining the teammate's PR #11 requirements and local execution facts. Task design v0.4 preserves cancellation/run limits, mistaken-association repair, selected personal AI input and truthful send states as requirements, separately from implemented features. Original docs branch history remains intact.
- Fix: Cleared comparison drafts after successful save/update/remove and topic deletion, preserving edits on storage failure. Browser trial used a newly created synthetic topic: save old reason → remove candidate → re-add with a new reason → compare; new reason appeared and old reason did not. Removed only that trial topic afterward; existing records were preserved. Public-only preview: /tmp/campus-agora-pr12-preview.png; local Web preview remains on 127.0.0.1:5173.
- Local verification: bun run ci:frontend (14 client + 44 Web tests), ci:backend (including temporary PostgreSQL 16 migration), ci:desktop, ci:contract, UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs, both discovery:validate batches and git diff --check passed. Temporary PostgreSQL was removed. Bun 1.4.2 locally versus pinned 1.3.14; existing roughly 762 kB / 187 kB gzip main-bundle warning remains.
- Remote verification: Implementation commit ffd4bd7 passed all six jobs (frontend/backend/desktop/contract/docs/container) in [CI run 37476445412](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/actions/runs/37476445412). Local ci:container was stopped during a slow base-image download; remote container build passed. This publication-log follow-up triggers a separate run; latest-head status belongs to GitHub, not the earlier run.
- Follow-up: Review PR #12 and continue the existing P2 tasks; no complete demo acceptance, integrated AI/Xiaohongshu collection, student benefit or ongoing-maintenance claim. Four proposed issue groups remain in todo.md.

### 2026-10-06 - Close superseded community PRs

- Result: At the user's request, closed [#4](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/4) M1 identity/authentication, [#5](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/5) M2.1 archive backend, [#6](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/6) M2.2 archive frontend, [#7](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/7) M3 discussion/archive and [#8](https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/8) M4 moderation/AI drafting. Fresh inventory and PR descriptions confirmed all five belonged to the canceled M-series; independent read-only scope review agreed.
- Verification: GitHub connector re-read all five as closed and unmerged, with unchanged head refs/SHAs; fresh open-PR search returned zero. CLI could not connect, so connector state updates and fresh reads supplied the remote evidence.
- Documentation checks: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed. No runtime/dependency change; no frontend/backend retest needed for this cleanup.
- Changed: Only PR open/closed state remotely; no merge, branch deletion, comment, reviewer request or new issue/PR. Local milestones.md and AI logs now record the cleanup; existing implementation work and merged requirements history were preserved without commit/push or other Git mutation.
- Follow-up: The proposed feature PR and four follow-up issues remain unpublished; latest-main reconciliation is still required as recorded in todo.md.

### 2026-10-05 - Assess PR and issue readiness against current GitHub state

- Result: Recommend one new feature PR for the implemented discovery/read/save/reopen/choice-support slice, with coherent commits and its dependent docs/tools/tests. Four proposed remaining outcome groups are lookup/update, topic conditions and discovery control, optional preparation/contact/resources, and complete demo/association-correction verification. PR and issue drafts prepared under /tmp; no remote issue, PR, branch, commit, push or review-request mutation.
- Remote evidence: GitHub lists #10 and #11 merged on October 3, zero issues, and open #4–#8 belonging to the superseded M-series. Connector comparison reports docs/requirements-handoff and main histories diverged; #11's nine-file diff contains teammate-adopted cancellation/run limits, mistaken-merge correction and selected personal AI input/send states absent from the current checkout. A new branch from latest main must reconcile these before publishing; do not replace them with local older docs.
- Fixes: requirements-handoff.md readiness now reflects the October 5 comparison and provisional implemented search/storage choices versus future AI/deployment decisions. AGENTS no longer incorrectly describes current Web as awaiting Primer migration. Kept the historical untracked HTML excluded as tools/prototypes/README.md already states.
- Verification: GitHub CLI PR/issue listing succeeded; subsequent direct API commands could not connect, so the available GitHub connector supplied compare metadata, #11 metadata/patch and current main requirements. UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed after local doc changes. Existing frontend/Rust/browser evidence reused within its date/scope; no code/dependency edits, unnecessary test repetition or claim that post-commit CI has passed.
- Follow-up: Publication plan is in todo.md; final PR body must replace preparation notes with actual reconciled base, commits and CI facts when submitted. Assessment readiness does not imply complete P3, student benefit, remote cleanup or published artifacts.

### 2026-10-05 - Implement and verify source-backed choice support

- Result: Existing Web demo now compares the actually collected Jiang/Song candidates by research, methods, graduate or undergraduate/RA/visit routes, unknowns and optional next investigation. Editable research focus offers conditional reading suggestions; no suitability scoring, model generation or new decision framework.
- Changed: App.tsx temporary compare state/actions and topic-scoped drafts; AdvisorComparison.tsx Primer DataTable/Details/form composition; advisor-comparison.ts source-bound profiles; advisor-comparison.test.ts five tests. Specific claims require the existing URL, batch and capture time; missing evidence suppresses that claim. Comparison removal never calls saved-record deletion.
- Browser evidence: Two labeled demo topics kept different private records for the same candidate; explicit save, perspective changes, zero/single candidates and reload preserved expected sources/notes. From comparison, newly created topic stores the actual current comparison question. 390px tables fit within the page, with no document horizontal overflow, and Enter/Tab expand sources and reach their links. Default viewport restored. These are agent-operated trials, not student feedback or benefit measurements.
- Verification: bun run ci:frontend passed (14 API-client and 44 Web tests, types, lint, UI source checks, production build). UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed. Focused source/storage/UI review found no actionable issues. Actual Bun remains 1.4.2 versus pinned 1.3.14; main chunk warning is now about 762 kB / 187 kB gzip and remains a later optimization.
- Documentation: Task design §8.4 plus overview, milestones, UI system, development guide and AGENTS separate the usable comparison from still-unimplemented live choice automation, preparation/resources and complete demo. Compare membership/perspective and unsaved drafts are page-only; saved private records remain per-topic in the existing browser store.
- Handoff: Local Web server on 127.0.0.1:5173; public comparison retained as a browser deliverable, with /tmp/campus-agora-choice-comparison.jpg showing only the public view. All changes remain local, not committed/pushed. Next is a concrete missing-information lookup or optional preparation/contact/resource entry, not another broad research cycle.

### 2026-10-05 - Research reusable choice-support methods and projects

- Result: Read primary project/product documentation for individual decision support, evidence-grounded comparison and advisor matching. Added open-source-reuse-reference.md §10: Research Application Toolkit Codex professor-match/school-select instructions, Entscheidungsnavi, Google Notebook (current official help displays Gemini Notebook), Argdown; conditional SilverDecisions/MakeDecision calculation and SurfSense citation paths, plus CSRankings as a limited original-site reference.
- Finding: The domain skill provides a concrete search/work/fit-reason workflow, not a verified matching engine. Prefer editable concerns, candidate differences, source-bound explanations and personal reasons; reuse existing two-candidate data before selecting a numerical decision library. Unknown conditions do not become low scores. Existing personal-choice/optional-help requirements unchanged.
- Boundaries: Documentation/source review only, no external skill invocation/installation, project runtime trial or private-data upload. Toolkit MIT root license read; Entscheidungsnavi root AGPL versus package ISC conflict retained; Argdown MIT project/package statements read but independent LICENSE not obtained; SurfSense proprietary directory exception retained. Public code is not automatically an unrestricted data source (CSRankings CC BY-NC-ND).
- Changed: Reference §10 with source links, reuse distinctions and a desk-constructed Jiang/Song comparison; constraints/index.md reading map; advisor-task-design.md §8.3 and pending implementation notes. Suggested conditional research-fit explanations are not implemented AI recommendations or observed student judgments.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed; no runtime changes, so no frontend/backend tests needed this turn. All changes remain local, not committed/pushed. Next slice is a small source-backed choice comparison under the existing Primer system.

### 2026-10-05 - Repeat browser discovery and display multiple batches

- Result: Explicitly invoked tools/skills/opportunity-discovery/SKILL.md; actually searched Xiaohongshu for “计算机系统 招生”, opened two recruitment posts, and corroborated against official faculty pages and their linked home/lab pages. The new apps/web/src/data/xhs-recruitment-2026-10-05.json contains Jiang Zuming (HKU) and Song Zhuoran (SJTU), seven source summaries, actual capture time and source-specific limits. No outreach, cookie export or new framework.
- Reading: Jiang's text and first of two images were read; second admissions image was not. Song's information was image-only, and all three images were viewed individually. Comments excluded. Displayed edit labels retained; current places, detailed eligibility and advising experience remain unknown. SJTU's conflicting title/body job labels are preserved. Identity/direction corroboration does not certify social account ownership.
- Changed: advisors.ts, collected-batch.ts, App.tsx and batch tests combine two batches with four research samples (seven unique people). Same candidate uses newest dated description and retains historical source snapshots; conflicting name/institution refuses an automatic merge. Top-level copy states stored reuse once. Source links include the observed same-site search entry, without access tokens. The October 4 JSON was not replaced.
- Browser verification: New candidates/details displayed. Saved both candidates to one clearly labeled demo topic, closed and reopened the same origin, and confirmed all seven sources, dates, scopes and separate reasons/questions restored. Existing saved records were not edited. No private-record screenshot was saved; /tmp/campus-agora-second-batch.jpg contains only the public candidate view. The demo tab and local Web server remain available.
- Fresh verification: bun run ci:frontend passed (14 API-client + 39 Web tests, types, lint, UI source checks and production build). Initial CI found JSON formatting only, fixed and rerun successfully. bun run discovery:validate apps/web/src/data/xhs-recruitment-2026-10-05.json, skill quick_validate.py, UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed. Existing bundle warning remains (732.52 kB / 177.13 kB gzip); no API/Rust change or backend tests in this round.
- Durable handoff: Updated development.md, advisor-task-design.md §8.2, open-source-reuse-reference.md §9 and the batch-format reference for the second executed batch, image reading and multi-batch reuse. Collection remains agent-driven; the application search still calls the existing public-HTML API, not Xiaohongshu. Benefit, full demo and unattended collection are not claimed; changes remain local, not committed/pushed.
- Next: Use these actual materials for two-candidate research/participation comparison; add more collection or a fixed browser adapter only for a concrete unresolved gap.

### 2026-10-05 - Verify user-assisted login and resumed reading

- Used the repository discovery skill and available connected browser. The Xiaohongshu home page had an account entry; its visible “更多” menu explicitly offered “退出登录”, confirming a signed-in state on this date without collecting account identifiers.
- Browser inventory exposed one controllable ordinary IAB profile; advertised capabilities did not include isolated/incognito sessions. A fresh tab shares the existing session and is not a logged-out trial. No sign-out, browser-data clearing, credentials, CAPTCHA solving or account creation occurred.
- Found Bilibili visibly signed out and opened/showed its original-site login window. The user reported completion; fresh UI inspection confirmed that the login window/prompt disappeared and account/navigation entries replaced the signed-out entry. The user handled authentication directly; no credentials or browser data were exported.
- Resumed the same browser session: searched “如何选择研究生导师”, selected articles, opened “如何选择合适的硕士生导师？” and read the article's text body. The original cv2411843 route redirected to https://www.bilibili.com/opus/239879292194055258; it showed the public author 张布衣的小仙女 and 2019-04-08 10:14. Used only as a technical reading check, not a new advisor record, current admissions rule or needs-research evidence.
- Updated tools/skills/opportunity-discovery/SKILL.md, AGENTS.md, development.md, open-source-reuse-reference.md, overview.md and advisor-task-design.md: October 4 available reading was not a sign-in verification; October 5 verifies user-assisted login and resumed search/body reading separately. No proof that reading requires login, authentication lasts indefinitely, Xiaohongshu login was tested, or the application includes a Bilibili collector.
- Retained the public article tab and a title/author-only screenshot at /tmp/campus-agora-bili-login-result.jpg. Temporary inspection/login/search tabs were closed without signing out accounts. No authentication material or account identity is in the handoff files.
- Verification: skill quick_validate.py, UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed. No runtime/dependency change; no frontend/backend tests needed for these instructions/status updates. Changes remain local, not committed/pushed.

### 2026-10-04 - Browser collection skill and actual Xiaohongshu batch

- Compared official browser/session tools and source repositories in open-source-reuse-reference.md §9. Created explicitly invoked tools/skills/opportunity-discovery/SKILL.md and its batch contract; no global installation or new browser framework.
- Normal connected-session search read one recruitment post by displayed author 顾尚定 Shangding Gu; the public SJTU directory corroborated name, institution and directions. Ten images and comments were not fully read; social-account identity, remaining places and advising experience remain unknown. Summaries, not full post copies, are in apps/web/src/data/xhs-recruitment-2026-10-04.json.
- Added a batch parser, deterministic tools/discovery/validate-batch.ts command and existing-guide integration. Source method, summary/body distinction, partial scope and collection-time label survive save/reopen. A canonical-link trial failed; title search located the same post, so the stored same-site lookup and access note are used in SourceView.
- Browser verification: latest data displayed, a labeled demo record was saved and reloaded, both sources and private reasons/questions were retained without adding duplicate sources. Only the public candidate view was retained as the delivery screenshot after automatic review rejected saving the personal-record view. No private record content is in this log.
- Fresh verification: bun run ci:frontend passed (14 API-client + 36 Web tests, types, UI source checks and production build); bun run discovery:validate apps/web/src/data/xhs-recruitment-2026-10-04.json and skill quick_validate.py passed. UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs and git diff --check passed after documentation edits. The existing large-bundle build warning remains a follow-up.
- The demo displays an actually collected stored batch. Collection was executed by the development agent/browser; the application's live search still uses its public-HTML API, not a Xiaohongshu collector. Standalone unattended collection, app-triggered Xiaohongshu search and student efficacy are not claimed. Changes remain local, not committed or pushed.

### 2026-10-04 - Run the first advisor discovery and saved-exploration slice

- Result: Implemented a usable Primer page, live public search/HTML reading, source/query/relevance/unknown context, user-confirmed existing or new candidates, independent local topics and private reasons/questions. Closed the browser tab, reopened the same origin, and verified both reviewed samples and saved live evidence restored. This is developer operation, not student trial or complete P3/demo acceptance.
- Changed: Web App/main/components/lib/tests, exact Primer dependencies and Bun lock, Vite API proxy; removed old AppShell/Button/custom CSS; API/application discovery with Rust/Cargo lock, OpenAPI/types/client and POST tests; UI source check and root typecheck dependency build. Synced task design/progress, development/quality/UI, API/backend/security/privacy docs. Earlier local documentation changes and historical untracked HTML preserved; no commit/push.
- Live execution: DuckDuckGo initially fetched Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia and CMU bodies, then returned a verification page. Limited official-directory fallback actually fetched Stanford faculty text for `机器学习`; the UI operator identified Chelsea Finn from the body and saved it with that source. Collection time is not publication time or current intake. Directory fallback states its two-site scope and retains primary-service failure; no fixtures/cache masquerade as live results.
- Browser verification: Saved distinct reasons for Tianqi Chen in two labeled demo topics, edited/reopened private notes, restored the live source's query/evidence/unknowns, checked 390px layout/no horizontal overflow and visible keyboard focus, then desktop layout. Full body is now optional behind an expand control after the directory list crowded the narrow page. `/tmp/campus-agora-first-loop.jpg` is a local screenshot artifact; localhost:5173 Web and localhost:8080 API were left running for use.
- Fixes: Bound default browser fetch after real `Illegal invocation` failure and added regression coverage; accept raw publication labels rather than ISO-only dates; preserve query/unknown context through source storage; avoid duplicate React source keys and accidental default candidate association. Repeated candidate saves retain prior private notes; unreadable storage is preserved and failed writes do not report success.
- Verification: `bun run ci:frontend` passed (typecheck, lint, UI source check, API-client tests, storage tests and production build). After final UI copy/body changes, Web build and source lint passed; API-client suite now has 14 passing tests, storage has 11. `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`, `cargo test --workspace`, agent `cargo fmt --all --check` and workspace Clippy passed. `bun run api:types` reproduced byte-identical current OpenAPI/types. Strict docs build and `git diff --check` passed. PostgreSQL migration smoke, Docker and inactive desktop checks were not run; no schema/desktop/container changes. These are not claims that all CI jobs passed.
- Decisions/limits: Same-browser/profile/origin localStorage, no sync/export/undo/server persistence; private notes never sent to discovery. Public query goes to DuckDuckGo, eligible host DNS may use fixed dns.google only for local 198.18/15 synthetic addresses; documented request/public address limits. No paid keys, model semantic explanation, private crawl or outreach. React18/Primer integration was built using actual Bun 1.4.2, not the project's pinned 1.3.14. Build's large-chunk warning remains a follow-up, not a failed build.
- Follow-up: Two-candidate comparison, topic-condition editing, search-in-progress condition change walkthrough, preparation/resource and contact support, complete demo checks and optional student feedback. Long-term maintenance is not a gate; free index availability and limited fallback are the present discovery constraints.

### 2026-10-03 - Reduce agent iteration overhead

- Result: Read primary OpenAI, Cursor, Aider and Anthropic development guidance and concrete internal cases; compared current GSD Core fast/quick, Superpowers and BMAD oneshot source for actual approval, planning, workspace and execution costs.
- Changed: AGENTS.md records the user's fast-iteration preference and current P2 stage; engineering/development.md replaces mandatory per-round task cards with task-sized planning and continuous implement/run/observe/fix. Updated the existing pending task; complete demo scope and Primer rules retained.
- Decisions: Clear small tasks execute directly; normal features use short plans; research resolves current blockers. Reuse read context, focus tests during edits, run affected required checks at completion and document changed decisions/handoff facts. Borrow useful skill methods without installing whole frameworks or adding auto-commits.
- Evidence limits: Vendor/team reports are practice evidence, not proof of project speed gains; Anthropic's Vim 70% figure is an internal self-report. GSD fast still auto-commits, Superpowers includes design gates and BMAD main contains unreleased changes; candidate names do not imply lightweight behavior.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. Research/documentation only; no skill installation, runtime implementation, commit or push.
- Follow-up: Execute the existing initial discovery/save/reopen slice under this default; evaluate actual working results and fix observed problems without another general process-research phase.

### 2026-10-03 - Define a lightweight iteration loop and assess development skills

- Result: Read primary GitLab, GOV.UK, Basecamp and OpenAI workflow/skill guidance; compared cached and current upstream Superpowers skill text. Recorded a five-step user-outcome loop, short task-card fields, risk-based verification and an initial actual-body discovery/save/reopen slice.
- Changed: engineering/development.md, product/advisor-task-design.md §8.1 and AI logs. Existing design/reuse edits and historical untracked HTML preserved; requirements scope and complete two-topic/comparison/demo acceptance unchanged.
- Decisions: Borrow short planning, completion evidence and debugging methods; skills are not executable discovery capability. Local Superpowers v5.1.3 cache is not an enabled session skill; upstream release notes list v6.4.2. No installation, global configuration change, application implementation, commit or push.
- Limits: Skill Installer's read-only listing helper ran but received GitHub HTTP 403; directly read public candidates instead, without claiming a complete catalogue. External skill instructions were research material, not approval gates or authorization to weaken the sandbox.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. Current Web `test` script checked as typecheck-only; no runtime/UI behavior or efficiency improvement claimed.
- Review: Read-only agent checked the initial-slice/full-demo distinction, reference-only skill status and current test scripts; no material issue found in those boundaries.
- Follow-up: Start the proposed slice with concrete source/storage/cost/data choices and investment limit; connect Primer interactions and actually verify external execution plus persistence. Continue full demo checks after this initial slice.

### 2026-10-03 - Research open-source reuse for task-design G1–G4

- Result: Searched/read official sources for 18 relevant projects: discovery/readers, research workflows, local persistence/search and source/notebook applications. Added source-backed comparison, maintenance/version evidence, license distinctions, two bounded trial paths and product-specific work that still remains. Static source checks identify reusable React/Vite/API infrastructure; existing post tables are not the new domain model.
- Changed: constraints/open-source-reuse-reference.md, constraints/index.md, MkDocs navigation, advisor-task-design.md reference and AI logs. Existing local design changes preserved; no commit/push, install, clone, integration or runtime edit.
- Review: Parallel agents checked discovery, research workflow and source/topic projects. Follow-up read-only review corrected the Readability LICENSE.md link and recorded a Firecrawl internal search failure/empty-result ambiguity. Open Deep Research archive status, custom/additional license terms, GPT Researcher metadata mismatch and cross-notebook source limitations retained.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. Documentation/source inspection only; no actual search-service integration, costs, domestic availability or user benefit measured.
- Follow-up: Choose a limited research-service vs small-components trial plus two-topic persistence, fix versions and data/cost boundaries before adding dependencies. No new requirements or maintenance gate adopted.

### 2026-10-03 - Translate requirements v1.0 into concrete task design

- Result: Replaced advisor-task-design.md v0.1 with v0.2: six user tasks, minimal operations and natural endings, actual external discovery, two-topic persistent continuation, public/private information relationships, exception recovery and demo walkthroughs traced to existing N requirements. Added G1–G5 suggested work packages, not assigned implementation tickets.
- Changed: advisor-task-design.md plus overview.md, milestones.md and requirements-handoff.md progress/cross-references; requirements scope and acceptance unchanged. Local documentation changes only, no commit/push or runtime edits; historical opportunities.html untouched.
- Review: Independent agent read-only review found an overly loose current-opening filter and a design suggestion mislabeled as a confirmed boundary; both corrected. This is agent review, not student testing or teammate approval.
- Verification: Strict docs build initially failed on an out-of-docs specimen link; replaced with a repository-path reference and fixed the section anchor. Final `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Follow-up: Primer interaction draft, bounded persistence/external-discovery experiments and technical/data boundaries. No new broad research, questionnaire, independent experience sample or measured benefit claimed.

### 2026-10-03 - Prepare requirements follow-up through the handoff branch

- Source: User requested handoff-branch publication followed by main integration after GitHub rejected a direct main push (PR required).
- Result: Verified the old handoff tree equals main's `09cb425`, merged that main baseline without conflicts, and copied the user's `c5673b5` as handoff commit `9696acd`. Original local main commit preserved. PR delivery uses squash merge after current CI verification.
- Verification: `git diff --exit-code main HEAD` passed before this log update; `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` passed. Follow-up differs only in the nine intended documentation/instruction files; delivery-log edits do not change product behavior.
- Follow-up: Apply v0.3 in technical/interaction trials; publishing documents is not implementation, teammate approval or demonstrated user benefit. GitHub PR records own the final CI and merge status.

### 2026-10-03 - Add cancellable discovery, merge correction and truthful AI send states

- Source: User accepted the three follow-up suggestions and requested their inclusion.
- Result: Task design v0.3 adds cancellation with partial-result preservation, declared per-run time/source-call/applicable-cost limits and stopping automatic retries; mistaken public merges can be split and repaired without losing private reasons or original references, with ambiguous associations confirmed by the user. Selected personal-content sending distinguishes confirmed unsent, sent/waiting, returned and delivery unknown; timeout/cancellation never imply data was not sent or retracted. Added corresponding acceptance checks and a planned complete walkthrough.
- Changed: AGENTS.md; docs/product/advisor-task-design.md, requirements-handoff.md, requirements.md, overview.md, milestones.md and privacy.md; AI logs. Preserved prior local requirements and log edits.
- Verification: `git diff --check` passed; 86 local Markdown links and 25 tables checked with 0 errors. `command -v uv` found no executable, so the MkDocs build remains unavailable; no runtime changes or runtime tests. Cross-checked new task-design behaviors with handoff 7–8, N12, privacy and P3.
- Scope: Requirements/design only, uncommitted and unpushed. Concrete run limits, provider cancel/delivery capabilities and storage repair mechanisms remain technical decisions; no implementation or completed demo claim.
- Follow-up: Exercise real discovery and the declared limits, partial-result cancellation, safe merge repair and selected-input/send-state handling during the planned walkthrough; simulations must stay separate from real discovery and user benefit.

### 2026-10-03 - Specify discovery-result handling, topic isolation and selected AI input

- Source: User asked to add result organization, existing-data merging, failure continuation and isolation of private reasons; clarified external AI may receive only personal content the user explicitly selects.
- Result: Task design v0.2 defines source-backed result organization, object reuse/new-fact association, deduplication and unresolved conflicts; partial failures preserve usable information, comparison choices and saved records. Private reasons belong to topic-candidate records, with separate edit/delete/reopen behavior. Personal-input selection covers AI requests, derived summaries, retries and prior context; unselected notes/topics are not attached, outputs stay private, and local deletion does not promise remote deletion.
- Changed: AGENTS.md; docs/product/advisor-task-design.md, requirements-handoff.md, requirements.md, overview.md, milestones.md and privacy.md; AI logs. Privacy now separates current personal-use boundaries from preserved historical community design. P3 explicitly includes persistent topics.
- Verification: `git diff --check` passed; 85 local Markdown links checked with 0 missing targets. `bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` attempted but could not run MkDocs because `uv` is not installed. Reviewed N02/N09, handoff 7–8, task design and privacy for matching behavior/acceptance wording.
- Scope: Requirements/design only; no provider, persistence technology, runtime feature, actual AI transfer or measured benefit claimed. No commit or remote push in this task; preserved earlier local AI-log changes.
- Follow-up: Implement and verify real discovery, merging/retries, two-topic reopen/isolation and selected outbound AI requests using the declared environment; confirm chosen services' retention/deletion terms. Teammate review and actual user effects remain open.

### 2026-10-03 - Read current project requirements and design readiness

- Source: User asked to inspect project requirements.
- Result: Read requirements-handoff.md, requirements.md, overview.md, advisor-task-design.md, current milestones and prototype status; checked the Web App shell. Current v1.0 supports continuing P2 design, without claiming P1 effect validation or a working demo. First delivery is the personal advisor-guide demo; broader opportunity research remains separate.
- Findings: Task design explicitly awaits actual external discovery and persistent multi-topic interactions; storage/deletion/AI transmission boundaries belong to implementation design. Milestones P3 still says persistence is added after scope confirmation, although N09 and handoff 8.2 already require it. Existing Web shell retains historical discussion/archive navigation and is not the current product implementation.
- Changed: AI logs only; preserved confirmed requirements and the preceding machine-local LFS repair log. Corrected PR #10 delivery status without implying teammate approval.
- Verification: Cross-checked N02/N09 and handoff 8.2 against task-design sections 1–3/5–6 and milestones P3; `git diff --check` passed. No runtime changes or runtime tests.
- Follow-up: Apply external discovery and multi-topic requirements to the existing task/information design, resolve implementation data boundaries, and align P3 wording; no new broad research or maintenance gate.

### 2026-10-03 - Repair local VS Code Git LFS hooks

- Source: User asked to fix VS Code Git LFS checkout/push errors.
- Result: VS Code logs show shell-environment resolution timeouts. Added a conditional `/opt/homebrew/bin` PATH fallback to local `.git/hooks/post-checkout`, `post-commit`, `post-merge` and `pre-push`, retaining their standard Git LFS checks and commands. Original hooks backed up under `/tmp/campus-agora-lfs-hooks-backup-20261003-194000`.
- Verification: `sh -n` and direct execution of all four hooks with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` passed (exit 0); executable permissions retained. `git diff --check` passed; main and origin/main remain at `09cb425`.
- Scope: Machine-local repair, no runtime changes or remote push; only this log is a tracked edit. Reinstalling/forcing LFS hooks can replace this local fallback. VS Code's general startup timeout has not been repaired or rechecked in the GUI.

### 2026-10-03 - Apply AI multi-dimension review findings to requirements v1.0

- Source: User asked for a review of the current requirements analysis, then asked to fix all reported issues.
- Result: A 9-dimension AI review (evidence, alternatives, tasks, scope/acceptance, consistency, eight-part contract, feasibility, privacy, readability) with 3-lens adversarial verification kept 8 of 46 findings; 4 low-cost refuted-but-factual items were also fixed. Handoff now states the named-experience precondition (source use + correction handler) in 8.2, overseas language/visa/identity conditions under N04, the contact-advisor scope boundary in 6.2, consistent automation-led supply wording in 2.3, S7–S9 in-text citations, a requirements.md row in the section 10 index, and Arno/skill glosses. requirements.md N04/N05/N11 rows and the G5 note updated; opportunity-needs-map G5 row and needs-analysis N10/N13 historical row annotated; 8.2 multi-topic wording no longer reads as sharing private reasons.
- Changed: docs/product/requirements-handoff.md, docs/product/requirements.md, docs/product/overview.md, docs/product/needs-analysis.md, docs/constraints/opportunity-needs-map.md.
- Verification: `git diff --check`; local relative-link check over the five edited docs (0 broken). `bun run docs:build` not run: `uv` is not installed locally.
- Decisions: Not applied (refuted as conflicting with confirmed decisions or already handled elsewhere): RSTAR/baseline comparison as a demo gate, objection-handling SLA, AI transfer scope and persistence timing in the requirements doc, privacy.md rewrite before implementation, adding columns to handoff tables. This is an AI review, not the pending teammate review.
- Follow-up: Teammate review of v1.0 remains open; advisor-task-design.md still needs the multi-topic/external-discovery revision.

### 2026-09-29 - Record advisor-guide first version and align baseline docs

- Source: User reviewed handoff section 2 and confirmed the first version is a 选导师指南 without a home/external campus split; asked to fix repository-level inconsistencies.
- Result: Handoff v0.6 (merged after the 2026-09-28 v0.5 research update) restructures section 2 into advisor main path, direct tasks and maintainer tasks; summary, section 6, 7.2 and 8.3 updated; non-research sample moved to a pre-expansion check. overview.md, milestones.md, needs-analysis.md and AGENTS.md record the decision. development.md design rules and monorepo-reference.md now defer to the Primer UI spec. Handoff links N/H definitions.
- Deferred by user: trigger timing/frequency, task layering detail, stance toward advisors as information subjects.
- Verification: `git diff --check`; docs build attempted (see commit notes).

### 2026-09-28 - Research student decision psychology

- Result: Added L14–L19 to student-development-literature.md (choice meta-analyses, autonomy experiment, Chinese social-comparison survey, career information experiment and JobMate v2). Recorded reading depth and noncausal/cross-context limits; reused L03/L12.
- Applied: Added task-specific concerns and support implications to needs-analysis.md and handoff v0.5. No psychological profiling, anxiety-reduction claim, new scope or universal research gate. JobMate v2 explicitly does not establish overall superiority; older stronger search summary not adopted.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. Paper evidence is distinct from actual USTC user observations.
- Follow-up: Evaluate optional-help interpretation, correctability and source distinctions within already-planned task trials; do not start a separate clinical assessment.

### 2026-09-27 - Strengthen the requirements argument

- Added current-process reconstruction, consequence/actionability analysis, five alternative approaches with priority rationale, and operational task-success criteria to needs-analysis.md; synchronized handoff v0.4 and requirements.md.
- Evidence: Existing records reused; journeys are analytical models, not observed behavior. Scope and criteria remain review proposals; no invented outcomes, prevalence or time thresholds. Existing P/N/H/V identifiers retained.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; no runtime changes.
- Follow-up: Peer review of alternative/priority choices and criteria; time budget, owner and actual user outcomes remain unresolved at their appropriate decision points. No universal new research gate.

### 2026-09-27 - Prepare complete documentation handoff for PR 10

- Source: User explicitly authorized all related documentation after scope discussion.
- Result: Included remaining product overview/milestones, AGENTS, reading navigation, UI reference, historical flags and AI logs; handoff updated to v0.3 with restored baseline links. Prototype README explicitly identifies unsubmitted local HTML.
- Verification: Strict workspace build and staged-only export build passed using existing dependency environment; staged diff check and documentation-only scope check passed. No runtime behavior or fresh production CI claim.
- Delivery: Prepared for PR 10 publication; peer review remains pending. Legacy opportunities.html intentionally excluded; no merge authorized.

### 2026-09-27 - Attach existing research in follow-up PR 10

- Result: Commit 85c96c7 adds six research records, full needs analysis, requirements, UI constraints and text specimen; handoff v0.2 links them with reuse/reading guidance. PR 9 was externally merged at c38c154; created https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/10 for the attachments. Restored PR 9 summary and linked the follow-up.
- Scope: Auto-review rejected initial broad staging; narrowed to 11 Markdown files and approval succeeded. AGENTS, architecture, other baseline edits and HTML remain unsubmitted. No merge.
- Verification: Strict workspace build and narrowed staged-only export build passed with existing dependency environment; diff check passed. Fresh dependency install in temporary export failed under network restrictions; reuse of existing environment resolved build. PR 10 verified OPEN at 85c96c7 with exactly 11 Markdown files.
- Follow-up: Peer review via handoff section 9. Older repository planning pages remain historical; v0.2 makes the review baseline explicit.

### 2026-09-27 - Publish requirements handoff PR

- Result: Opened https://github.com/114August514/campus-agora/pull/9 from `docs/requirements-handoff` into `main` at user request.
- Verification: `gh pr view 9 --json url,state,baseRefName,headRefName,files,commits` confirms OPEN, one commit c38c154 and only docs/product/requirements-handoff.md (223 additions). Commit diff check passed.
- Scope: Other working changes preserved; no merge or direct collaborator message. User will share the PR and document; review remains pending.

### 2026-09-27 - Deliver requirements handoff for peer review

- Result: Created self-contained eight-part analysis with summary, source table, N/P traceability, scope recommendations, task acceptance, open decisions and peer feedback template. No invented user tests or current opportunity claims.
- Commit: `c38c154` contains only `docs/product/requirements-handoff.md` (223 lines). Earlier workspace edits and these log updates remain outside the commit; no push or message sent.
- Verification: Strict documentation build, `git diff --check`, and section/source coverage checks passed. Build reports the standalone handoff is not in site navigation; direct file is the intended delivery.
- Follow-up: Collaborators review scope/value and decision-relevant gaps using section 9; incorporate accepted changes into formal baseline and task/information design. Review not yet performed.

### 2026-09-27 - Research mature-team requirements practices

- Result: Compared GitLab, Atlassian, Basecamp and GOV.UK primary sources; documented evidence reuse, scope/investment decisions and separate readiness for design versus development.
- Changed: Added constraints/requirements-practice-reference.md, indexed it and added documentation navigation. No runtime or product-scope changes.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Decisions: Methods are contextual examples, not universal gates. Existing eight-part baseline remains; no new research checklist required.
- Follow-up: Apply baseline to task/information structure; clarify investment and ownership during implementation planning, without inventing budgets or claiming measured benefit.

### 2026-09-27 - Consolidate reviewable requirements and adopt evidence reuse

- Result: Added current requirements conclusions to needs-analysis.md, replaced stale next-work/exit language, synchronized requirements.md, overview.md, milestones.md and AGENTS.md. Explicitly recommend core discovery/understanding/comparison, substantive experience support and optional preparation/resources; lightweight private records remain a design recommendation, push/automatic progress are not first-release essentials.
- Decisions: Existing scoped evidence is sufficient for needs conclusions. No repeated research, participant reply or all H/V completion as a universal gate. Needs baseline is reviewable; full P1 efficacy and sustained supply remain unvalidated. Conditional backlog retained without claiming completion.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only, no new data or runtime work.
- Follow-up: Task/information-structure design; targeted unknowns handled where they affect decisions, claims or release readiness.

### 2026-09-27 - Add empirical information-seeking evidence to needs argument

- Result: Added L10–L13 to student-development-literature.md: Chinese job-source interview abstract (18 successful job seekers), US everyday-search methods/results (8,353 responses, 7.4% response rate), Chongqing interpersonal-seeking abstract (328 cases), and digital-divide abstract with unknown sample detail. Main needs-analysis now separates finding from relevance judgment and preserves existing-channel benefits.
- Decisions: Multiple sources can complement one another; aggregation need is not inferred from fragmentation. Historical/nonlocal studies do not establish current USTC or generative-AI behavior. Blocked/placeholder sources not counted; same PIL dataset not treated as replication. No new UI, content specimen, outreach or population estimate.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; docs only.
- Follow-up: Local task-specific unresolved consequences and current alternatives remain missing evidence.

### 2026-09-26 - Separate user need, unmet gap and feasibility evidence

- Result: Added P01–P07 justification review to needs-analysis.md; distinguished direct initiator requests, literature context, source differences and unsupported behavior assumptions. Corrected P03 mandatory-output residue and P05 attribution; separated entry/recognition/progress and saving/notification needs.
- Decisions: Aggregation can be useful without exclusive content; existing source facts do not establish usability or eliminate potential value. Experience information remains a substantive need, not merely questions/notes. Further mentor specimen work is paused behind main needs argument; no new participant evidence or demand ranking.
- Changed: needs-analysis.md sections 4–5 and H5, requirements.md, milestones.md, AI logs.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Establish task-specific existing-method gaps and natural success conditions; actual-task reply and independent users remain optional missing evidence, not fabricated results.

### 2026-09-26 - Connect existing candidates to concrete research questions

- Result: Read Chen homepage/FAQ, MPK team page and USENIX abstract, Zhang homepage and Clearblue programming-model docs. Extended opportunity-content.md with question/method comparison and optional reading paths; documented source depth in aids-mentor-research.md and progress in needs-analysis.md.
- Decisions: Coauthorship is not advising responsibility; project methods are not observed lab routines. CMU-student participation notice is not an external-student invitation; research-scientist hiring is not degree intake. Candidate works are not linked to MPI/ISTA programs. Removed fixed six-hour trial suggestion as a general preparation expectation.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. No paper reproduction, contact, user study or new candidate ranking.
- Follow-up: Real personal preference, team experience, applicable intake and full pilot remain unverified; no additional directory expansion implied.

### 2026-09-26 - Produce source-backed text specimens

- Result: Wrote tools/prototypes/opportunity-content.md with MPI/ISTA program comparison and brief Xingce entry lookup; refreshed three official sources. Added author source-check results to needs-analysis.md and linked specimen from prototype README.
- Decisions: Different tasks need different content depth. Program conditions do not complete mentor/work-interest comparison. Two-month example is constructed, not user preference. QR destination and actual team experience remain unverified. No frontend implementation, user-benefit test or independent model baseline.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; source statements reviewed against current returned official text. No runtime changes.
- Follow-up: Research-work/team fit and actual-user observations remain; prototype is a review artifact, not a completed pilot.

### 2026-09-26 - Consolidate candidate scope without inventing validation

- Result: Replaced needs-analysis section 6's broad mandatory-path suggestions with confirmed principles, common-base candidates, conditional capabilities and unresolved release choices. Added task-specific natural endings and a bounded research-pilot recommendation with lightweight counterexamples.
- Changed: needs-analysis.md, requirements.md N06/path wording, milestones.md and AI logs.
- Decisions: Preparation does not universally require a work product or exercise. Research-specific person/work relationships are not mandatory for every opportunity. Conditional experience/compare support remains valuable; no final coverage, implementation or measured-benefit claim. Recent-task question remains unanswered and optional.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; docs only.
- Follow-up: Actual task evidence and source-cost evidence still inform release selection; independent progress does not require repeatedly asking the same recall question.

### 2026-09-26 - Prepare neutral actual-task observation and request recall

- Result: Asked initiator for a recent concrete discovery/support episode. Added ready-to-use recall sequence and task-level decision rules to needs-analysis.md; response still pending.
- Decisions: Existing stated research preferences are personal demand evidence, not a completed search episode. Constructed time limits are not user facts. Ask about satisfactory existing methods and non-information barriers before showing a solution. Retrospective recall is distinct from observation and does not establish independent V2 coverage.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; no external outreach or invented participant data.
- Follow-up: Analyze the actual answer when supplied, then identify a contrasting voluntary nonauthor task; do not duplicate public case research in place of missing behavior evidence.

### 2026-09-26 - Contrast lightweight tasks and existing peer support

- Result: Read USTC 2026 club-fair report, USTCGUIDE preface and historical first-person elective-course account; re-read Xingce entry. Compared constructed interest browsing, mixed-motive course exploration, direct lookup and existing deep research case.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md evidence/contrast; needs-analysis.md alternatives, progress and H3 status; requirements.md lightweight acceptance examples; AI logs.
- Decisions: Existing alternatives include face-to-face exploration and student guides. One public personal account adds non-organizer evidence, not corroborated current experience or representative demand. Current event availability, QR destination and user benefit remain unverified. No new feature implementation or outreach.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed.
- Follow-up: Observe actual task starting points and natural endings; do not substitute further case accumulation for user evidence.

### 2026-09-26 - Assess and correct requirements research bias

- Result: Reviewed needs analysis, N01–N13, evidence-map structure and work order. Identified research-case, official-source, skilled-searcher, deep-workflow, rules/maintenance, solution/baseline and validation-process biases. Nonresearch cases exist; their depth does not yet establish broad demand.
- Changed: needs-analysis.md section 7 assessment and current H2 status; requirements.md optional workflow clarification; milestones.md next-work order; AI logs.
- Decisions: Keep accepted personal-use scope and mentor pilot. Prioritize contrasting real task starting points/depth; maintenance supports selected tasks. No population estimates or new user evidence; no need for equal sample counts or every validation before a bounded prototype.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Actual exploratory/lightweight/deep-choice tasks and ordinary alternatives remain to be observed; a single contrasting participant cannot establish coverage.

### 2026-09-26 - Recheck two research sources and bound timing claims

- Result: Re-read ISTA and MPI official source text; documented missing lead-time and pathway conditions. No detected source-rule change; local-summary enrichment only.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md, needs-analysis.md, requirements.md and AI logs.
- Evidence: Sequential UTC clock boundaries yield 128 and 14 seconds through per-record decision writing; first includes context-management interference. Familiar-source AI wall time is not human labor, cold-start effort, real-update cost or user savings. H6 remains unvalidated.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` passed. `git diff --check` checked at handoff. No runtime changes, outreach or application submissions.
- Follow-up: Initial creation, independent human review, actual changed-source handling, maintenance owner/budget and participant comparison remain pending.

### 2026-09-26 - Execute research and cultural-exchange source walkthroughs

- Result: Read official MPI CS internship, paused ISTernship and year-round ISTA pages; read USTC notices for XJTU, NJU and Fudan summer programs. Recorded author-constructed two-month research and two-week cultural-exchange comparisons, original-site strengths, source-date limits and unresolved conditions.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md evidence and partial V status, needs-analysis.md progress, requirements.md N03/N08 relationship examples, AI logs.
- Decisions: Institution status differs from individual program/cycle; umbrella dates differ from subproject dates; absence of a fixed pre-admission research topic is valid. All sampled 2026 cultural programs are historical. No user-benefit or independent-experience claim.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. No applications, outreach or sign-in. No independent AI/user baseline or per-record timing.
- Follow-up: Reuse materials for controlled comparison or measured maintenance; domestic research coverage and experience supply still incomplete.

### 2026-09-26 - Consolidate task-to-unmet-need arguments

- Result: needs-analysis.md section 4 now links seven concrete tasks to existing alternatives, hypothesized gaps, desired outcomes and existing H/V decisions. Preserved external research discovery, nonresearch choices and actual-experience needs without claiming observed prevalence.
- Changed: needs-analysis.md, requirements.md and AI logs. Reworded P06 as determining whether activities satisfy existing requirements; erroneous recommendations remain a risk rather than an observed user event.
- Decisions: Publicly available experience and private judgment remain meaningful needs; official-platform constraints are unverified. No automatic black/red rankings, scoring or community scope added. Missing source material cannot be replaced by generated explanation.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. Existing evidence consolidated; no new browsing, participant observation, independent AI comparison or timing performed.
- Follow-up: Execute existing cross-institution discovery and nonresearch comparison tasks; check actual-experience supply and maintenance effort. P1 remains open.

### 2026-09-25 - Stabilize background and target-user baseline

- Result: needs-analysis.md sections 1–2 now separate documented context, adopted research scope and unvalidated prevalence/benefit. Defined overlapping task states, direct student users versus information subjects, institutional information coverage versus service rollout, pilot versus first-release priority.
- Changed: needs-analysis.md, overview.md, requirements.md and AI logs; existing evidence retained, no new fieldwork claims.
- Decisions: Background and overall audience are usable baselines; first-release segment and demand strength remain open. Official-platform feedback limitations remain hypotheses. Keep H1–H6/V1–V5 as the sole validation framework.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Existing cross-source discovery, experience-supply, different-goal participant and maintenance tasks remain pending.

### 2026-09-25 - Specify cross-institution research discovery hypothesis

- Result: User-proposed external university, institute and overseas project discovery promoted from coverage scope to a priority differentiation hypothesis in overview.md and needs-analysis.md.
- Decisions: Retain local opportunities and broad disciplines; relate research tasks to participation conditions, not just mentor names. RSTAR external coverage remains unknown; counts and geography do not prove value.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. No new external research or user-benefit tests in this positioning update.
- Follow-up: Cross-institution discovery comparison and source-maintenance validation tracked in todo.md.

### 2026-09-25 - Review RSTAR public workflows as a local alternative

- Result: Browser-observed homepage search entry points, project/mentor/resource previews and lectures; mentor discovery and selected project detail redirected to authentication. No login or submission; no authentication URLs persisted.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md detailed source/observation boundaries and comparison plan; needs-analysis.md existing-solutions baseline; todo.md authenticated follow-up.
- Decisions: Local mentor/project/resource aggregation already exists. Treat RSTAR as a direct research-scenario alternative and link candidate; potential cross-source/personal-workflow gains remain hypotheses, not verified RSTAR omissions. No UI-rule change or automatic data integration.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. User benefit, search quality and login-only behavior untested.

### 2026-09-25 - Map departmental evaluation sources and recognition applicability

- Result: Read information-school class-rule revision report and historical recommendation rule, mathematics-school historical recommendation rule, cyber/engineering/computer-school reports, and the official 2025 competition-management PDF with its 2024 directory. Recorded departmental search gaps without treating missing results as absent policies.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md source inventory; overview.md and requirements.md applicability/overlapping-purpose rules; todo.md remaining source acquisition.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. Documentation-only work; no runtime checks or user validation performed.
- Decisions: Enjoyment and formal recognition can be simultaneous. Department/cohort/class context follows actual documents; school credit/GPA recognition is not a departmental comprehensive-evaluation whitelist. No current personal score calculation supported.
- Follow-up: Obtain applicable current departmental originals and attachments; execute multi-purpose and mismatched-rule task checks. No claim of complete departmental coverage or P1 completion.

### 2026-09-25 - Broaden contest samples and separate participation motives

- Result: Read USTC recreational card tournament, USTCPC rules, systems-design contest report, credit/GPA recognition notice and engineering-school comprehensive-evaluation sharing report. Added type × motive research framework and explicit source/eligibility limits.
- Changed: AGENTS.md, overview, requirements, needs-analysis, opportunity-needs-map and AI LOG.
- Decisions: Enjoyment, shared participation, recognition and development are equal legitimate optional purposes. Prizes, credits/GPA and comprehensive evaluation are distinct; no confirmed personal comprehensive-evaluation score. Physics contest remains one sample, no automatic preparation or fixed motive labels.
- Verification: Primary pages read; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` checked before handoff; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Applicable unit/year recognition rules, arts/design cases and real motive-specific choices; no participation or motive prevalence measured.

### 2026-09-25 - Consolidate hypotheses and execute contest source check

- Result: needs-analysis.md §8 now owns H1–H6 evidence/gaps/decision outcomes and V1–V5 meanings; removed divergent scenario-specific V table from requirements. Recorded four-source readiness check and added a fresh USTC 2025 physics-experiment contest organizer report to opportunity-needs-map.md.
- Changed: Needs analysis, requirements, milestones, opportunity-needs-map and AI LOG.
- Decisions: Separate discovery from fixed-material explanation; method/questions from actual experience data; allow partial evidence without declaring full validation complete. Contest report supports historical process association, not participant satisfaction, time estimates, current eligibility or success probability.
- Verification: Primary contest report read; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` checked before handoff. No participant tests, independent AI baseline or cost timing executed.
- Follow-up: Bounded experience-source checks, comparable candidate task and first independent content-maintenance timing; participants needed only for real behavior/return evidence.

### 2026-09-25 - Generalize experience-informed selection across scenarios

- Result: Promoted actual-content/experience/commitment judgment to a common opportunity/resource problem; removed mentor/employment/long-term-only scope from overview, N11, P07 and research reference.
- Changed: AGENTS.md, overview, requirements, needs analysis, milestones, opportunity-needs-map and AI LOG.
- Decisions: Shared source/context/conflict/unknown/private-judgment handling; scenario-specific questions and optional depth. Simple entry lookups can end immediately. Broader user-approved scope does not establish equal demand or source availability.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` checked before handoff; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Non-mentor/employment comparison and entry-only task; direct evidence outside mentor/internship cases remains incomplete.

### 2026-09-25 - Extend core comparison to experienced quality

- Result: Added primary mentorship research (40-person purposive negative-experience sample), two-case abstract, Penn guidance, NACE survey summary and internship criteria to opportunity-needs-map.md. Preserved sample/read limitations; no named allegations collected.
- Changed: Product overview, N11 in requirements, P07/value in needs analysis and AI LOG.
- Decisions: Actual tasks, support, commitments and personal fit belong to core comparison across mentors and internships/employment. Separate self-description, records, experiences and private judgments; preserve unknowns/context, no personality scores. Public disclosure or community is not required. Guidance-only value does not mean hidden experiences have been obtained.
- Verification: Primary pages read; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` checked before handoff; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Local/regular-employment evidence, actual source access and willing task observations; compare a generic question list before assuming richer features help.

### 2026-09-25 - Compare core information tasks against existing services

- Result: Re-read advisor intake, MSRA internship, USTC contest and Xingce pages; compared existing college recruitment aggregation and Stanford SOLO scope. Added four task comparisons, minimal outputs and disconfirming outcomes to opportunity-needs-map.md; promoted conclusions into needs-analysis.md.
- Decisions: Prioritize discovery, relation mapping and conditional comparison; original-page completeness may mean a direct link is enough. Chapter teaching remains withdrawn. Separate fixed-material understanding checks from open discovery and single-object checks from multi-candidate comparison.
- Limits: MSRA sample dated 2025, contest signup ended, advisor status is a read snapshot without update date; MIT UROP only search excerpt with failed body fetch. No active-opening guarantee, participant results, independent AI baseline or maintenance timings.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` checked before handoff; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Use the four bounded tasks for actual contrasts, add comparable candidates only where required, record maintenance costs and distinct user goals.

### 2026-09-25 - Persist product focus and withdraw teaching drift

- Result: Bound discovery/understanding/comparison as core, preparation priorities as support and resource connections as assistance. Direct resource search and broad user research remain valid; chapter links are optional details.
- Changed: AGENTS.md; product overview, requirements, needs analysis and milestones; student-development reference; AI LOG.
- Decisions: Removed chapter-level requirements and knowledge-learning experiments from current validation and pending tasks. Earlier course research and protocols are historical supporting evidence, not P1 work or exit criteria. This supersedes the teaching-related follow-ups in the two earlier entries below.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` (results checked before handoff); documentation only.
- Follow-up: Compare discovery and selection tasks against original sites/general AI; identify minimum guidance and resource support, with willing participants and maintenance timing still pending.

### 2026-09-25 - Inspect concrete course sections and prepare task comparison

- Result: Read USTC CS1001A description, separate OJ program-design-B exercise, CS50P loops and Python control-flow sections. Documented language, section-granularity, course-identity and read/submit mismatches; no claim of learner benefit.
- Changed: Student-development reference §8, needs analysis, requirements and AI LOG.
- Verification: Source text inspected; strict docs build and `git diff --check` run for this documentation change. No login, submissions, independent model baseline or participant experiment.
- Follow-up: Execute four task situations with willing participants, original-site/AI/product controls, voluntary understanding checks and return; record per-stage production/update cost and source owners.

### 2026-09-25 - Separate resource availability from suitability

- Result: Added three learning-research references with access limits and a Python tutorial/CS50P/visualizer comparison. Explicitly left the user's actual school course unassessed. Corrected automatic reuse language in overview, requirements and needs analysis.
- Decisions: Evaluate availability, access, task fit and benefit separately; preserve official handling authority. Allow explanation, alternatives and short paths when existing guidance is unsuitable. Preferences do not establish efficacy or fixed learning-style categories.
- Verification: Primary research/resource pages checked; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. No learner experiment, enrolment or runtime implementation.
- Follow-up: Obtain task-specific school course materials and compare resource choice, voluntary understanding checks and burden; do not infer superiority from provider or format.

### 2026-09-25 - Check existing USTC support against student tasks

- Result: Extended student-development-literature.md with six public-source support cases and three optional-help examples. Existing academic advising, career consultation and contest guidance constrain the proposed product gap; did not claim widespread unawareness or absent services.
- Changed: Student-development reference, needs analysis, milestones and AI LOG.
- Verification: Read official pages on 2026-09-25; separated historical events, current listings and inaccessible details. `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. No login, contacts, applications or runtime changes.
- Follow-up: Original-site/general-AI task contrasts, willing participants, one-week return and per-record production/update timing. Academic booking availability, internship details and complete historical guidance materials remain unverified; source maintenance owners are not assigned.

### 2026-09-24 - Persist optional help and personal pace

- Result: Bound user instruction to offer help/resources without presenting every opportunity as essential. Declining is valid even when eligible; viewing/saving does not create obligations. Defined restrained guidance, opt-in reminders and accurate official requirements.
- Changed: `AGENTS.md`, product overview, requirements, needs analysis and AI LOG.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Observe information burden and misreading of optional advice during P1 tasks; do not claim proven anxiety reduction. No UI or notification behavior implemented this turn.

### 2026-09-24 - Review social-science evidence for student task segmentation

- Result: Added `docs/constraints/student-development-literature.md`: nine studies/research texts spanning adjustment, unequal career awareness, exploration, internships, competitions, self-regulated learning, burnout and postgraduate choices. Recorded actual full-text/abstract/index-only access and study limits; no fabricated sample totals or local prevalence.
- Changed: Literature reference, needs analysis, requirements, milestones, constraints index, MkDocs and AI LOG.
- Decisions: Treat year as context, not a deterministic recommendation. Add current-course learning support as a distinct research task. Preserve internships/competitions/graduate paths as hypotheses and separate information gains from choice certainty. No feature implementation or questionnaire launched.
- Verification: Source pages checked 2026-09-24; inspected population/design/result consistency and evidence-to-product inference. `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only.
- Follow-up: Local support-supply check and actual task contrasts; full-text limits remain explicit, especially the competition journal's 502 response.

### 2026-09-24 - Consolidate the eight-part needs analysis

- Result: Added `docs/product/needs-analysis.md` covering background, task-based users, alternatives, unmet needs, value, scope, requirements and feasibility. Linked local and external cases; distinguished facts, personal requests, hypotheses and missing observations. No new participant findings claimed.
- Changed: Needs report, product overview/requirements/milestones, MkDocs navigation and AI LOG.
- Decisions: AIDS remains the first pilot only. Same-task comparison includes general-purpose AI; valid outcomes include stopping. Promoted the four P1 bias checks into formal requirements and the report. Two-key supply proposal remains unadopted; campus API availability is not reopened as a needs blocker.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` passed strict build; `git diff --check` passed. Documentation only; no runtime changes or tests.
- Follow-up: Execute alternative-method comparisons, maintenance timing and ownership decisions; obtain a willing different-goal participant and one-week return observation. P1 and first-release scope remain open.

### 2026-09-24 - Read network-center posts on 词元计划 coverage

- Result: School news dated 2026-09-12, attributed to the network center, says 词元计划 was opened directly to faculty and students on 2026-05-07. By early September, 12,000 people had used https://llm.ustc.edu.cn; the platform offers a standard API and had processed over 1.4 trillion tokens. A February 2025 post from the WeChat account 中国科大网络信息服务, republished on Sohu, already offered local DeepSeek at https://chat.ustc.edu.cn and in the 中国科大 app to all enrolled faculty and students. The original WeChat archive was not fully retrieved.
- Changed: `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG.
- Decisions: Whether a student already holds a key is no longer a needs-analysis question. Guidance may assume 词元计划. Per-person quota and pasting a key into this site stay implementation checks. The two-key shape is still not built.
- Verification: News pages fetched 2026-09-24. `git diff --check` on the edited docs.
- Follow-up: None for the needs question of key possession.

### 2026-09-24 - Check 词元计划 before judging student API keys

- Result: USTC 词元计划 is the campus LLM service at https://llm.ustc.edu.cn, run by the network center. School news on 2026-06-03 says that by 2026-06-02 it had served over 4,000 faculty and students and over 100 billion tokens. A 2026-04-25 network-center note says the platform is open to all faculty and students and supports both API calls and visual chat. The live site includes key-management assets. This session did not log in, so per-person quota and third-party use of a personal key are unread.
- Changed: `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG.
- Decisions: Withdraw "most USTC students have no API key" as a reason to reject the two-key idea. Do not treat platform existence as proof that guidance keys already work in this product. The proposal stays unadopted until quota, external use, and stable guidance quality are checked.
- Verification: News page and llm.ustc.edu.cn fetched 2026-09-24. No login. `git diff --check` on the edited docs.
- Follow-up: Read the logged-in key application rules before designing guidance around 词元计划.

### 2026-09-24 - Review the two-key supply proposal instead of accepting it

- Result: User stopped the wholesale acceptance. Checked the proposal against the personal-use audience and P1 validation. Fixed workflow, pre-published information, and guidance that can be missing are compatible. Defaulting concrete guidance to a key the student brings is not: most intended users have no key, and guidance quality would vary with that key, so V1 could not be compared. A second key we ourselves hold is an operations split, not a user-facing dependency. Xiaohongshu and unapproved group collection stay out of the default sources.
- Changed: `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG. Earlier wording that called the shape accepted is withdrawn.
- Decisions: The proposal remains on record and is not a product decision. No crawl or key client is authorized by it.
- Verification: `git diff --check` on the edited docs.
- Follow-up: Revisit only if a later decision chooses whose key pays for guidance and how a student without a key still gets it.

### 2026-09-24 - Correct which API key serves information and which serves guidance

- Result: User rejected the split that showed raw crawl records with no key and ran all agent work on one maintainer key. Information is produced with our own webpage-maintenance API key and can be shown as published. Concrete guidance uses a separately supplied API key and stops where that key's capabilities stop.
- Changed: `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG. No crawler or key client added.
- Decisions: Two keys, neither stored in the repository. A missing guidance key does not hide information already published. Raw extracts are not the visitor-facing information layer.
- Verification: `git diff --check` on the edited docs.
- Follow-up: Supply todo now uses this split. Still do not build either key path.

### 2026-09-24 - Split the fixed workflow from API-key processing

- Result: User fixed the supply shape. The site shows one real workflow. Crawled records from chosen pages can be shown with no API key. Filtering, readable rewrites, and preparation drafts depend on the capabilities of a maintainer-supplied key; steps the key cannot do stay marked as not generated.
- Changed: `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG. No crawler or API client added.
- Decisions: The workflow does not change when the key changes. Keys are not stored in the repository. Source tiers and the ban on unapproved group collection stay as previously recorded.
- Verification: `git diff --check` on the edited docs.
- Follow-up: Still do not build the crawl or the key-backed steps until the open supply todo's checks have results.

### 2026-09-24 - Record the hoped-for maintenance workflow

- Result: User wants maintenance to move from hand-written cards to a workflow that fetches chosen pages, lets an agent filter, and publishes readable text. Xiaohongshu and group bots were named as further sources.
- Changed: `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG. No crawler or bot added.
- Decisions: Chosen public pages are the first automation candidate. Xiaohongshu stays personal experience and depends on whether that collection is allowed. A group bot is in scope only after that group agrees; unapproved group chats are not collected. Published text must be readable and must separate official fact, personal experience, and unknown. Someone still owns the source list and corrections. V5 timing is still required before building this.
- Verification: `git diff --check` on the edited docs.
- Follow-up: Open todo "Automated supply workflow, not yet built".

### 2026-09-24 - Read the Marxism School Xingce signup notice

- Result: The signup notice is https://marx.ustc.edu.cn/2023/0606/c30320a605104/page.htm on the notice board. It tells students to scan a code for current large lectures and small classes, including open and closed registration, then submit a signup form. Attendance is classroom check-in. Students may email instructors to request a class. The image filename indicates the code was replaced on 2026-09-17. The code itself was not decoded, so the session list and credit marks are still unread.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md, product overview, requirements N13, milestones P1-07, AI LOG.
- Decisions: Hearing a lecture and submitting the year-3 report are different entrances. N13 stays unverified until the code target is read.
- Verification: Page fetched 2026-09-24. QR decode with OpenCV returned no payload. `git diff --check` on the edited docs passed.
- Follow-up: Open the code target and record fields, quotas, and whether a session is marked as counting.

### 2026-09-24 - Withdraw the claim that Xingce has no public signup site

- Result: User corrected the desk check. A dedicated signup website exists. Public search did not open it, and that miss was wrongly written as if no per-event signup entry had been found.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md, product overview, requirements N13, milestones P1-07, AI LOG.
- Decisions: Credit rules from 教字〔2024〕19号 and the FAQ stay. Statements about the signup site wait until its URL is read. N13 remains unverified.
- Verification: Doc correction only.
- Follow-up: Read the signup site once the user supplies the URL.

### 2026-09-24 - Desk-check the Xingce requirement against official rules

- Result: Read 教字〔2024〕19号 and the academic-affairs FAQ. 形势与政策 is an existing multi-year requirement: 8 non-academic lectures, two reports, first submission in year-3 fall weeks 1–4 via 瀚海教学网, with email/SMS after the course is placed. No public per-event eligibility calendar was found. Login lists were not tested. Added candidate N13: judge whether an event counts and show progress; stop instead of adding preparation when it does not count.
- Changed: `docs/constraints/opportunity-needs-map.md`, `docs/product/requirements.md`, `docs/product/overview.md`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, AI LOG.
- Decisions: This does not put 行策 into the first release, does not close V1–V5, and does not close the P1 validation bias checks. N06's optional preparation step does not apply to a non-counting event.
- Verification: `git diff --check` on the edited docs. No user observation and no authenticated page.
- Follow-up: Log in before claiming there is no eligibility list. Keep notice-to-follow-up and task planning as separate ordinary-week alternatives.

### 2026-09-24 - Bind P1 perspective biases into the AI log

- Result: Reviewed the current P1 frame. It fits a student who already intends to apply and can research, then needs to understand an opportunity and start preparing. Treated as the whole product, that frame is skewed.
- Changed: `docs/ai-log/todo.md`, `docs/ai-log/done.md`. No product-scope or runtime change.
- Decisions: Later sessions must apply the open "P1 validation bias checks" item before counting V1–V5. The author's own mentor replay, a research-to-employment switch, and per-record timing do not by themselves close P1. A general-purpose chatbot is part of the baseline. One correct outcome is to stop. A second person who did not write the cards is required for user evidence. Maintenance must name who continues after the author stops.
- Verification: Doc edit only. `git diff --check -- docs/ai-log/todo.md docs/ai-log/done.md` passed.
- Follow-up: Bias checks remain in `docs/ai-log/todo.md`. Formal V1–V5 text in `docs/product/requirements.md` is unchanged.

### 2026-09-23 - Cross-user and cross-opportunity evidence map

- Result: Eight overlapping user states, ten case/data groups, alternatives,
  G1–G7 shared needs with domain differences and five task scenarios. Mentor
  discovery remains one pilot; no premature MVP narrowing.
- Changed: opportunity-needs-map.md, product overview/milestones, constraints
  index, MkDocs navigation and AI LOG.
- Evidence: Official notices, SOLO/Handshake help, platform survey methods;
  clearly distinguishes published counts, product hypotheses and source limits.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  and `git diff --check` passed. No user testing or runtime implementation.
- Follow-up: Broaden remaining coverage, observe real tasks, test supply cost;
  current Xingce endpoint and authenticated service capabilities remain unknown.

### 2026-09-23 - Restore product-wide needs research

- Result: User clarified AIDS mentor discovery is only the first pilot. Current
  P1 covers users across disciplines/stages/goals and multiple opportunity types;
  product potential, research scope and implementation order are now separated.
- Changed: AGENTS.md, product overview/milestones, scope notes in both mentor
  research references, AI LOG. Added P1-11 for cross-scenario evidence.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  and `git diff --check` passed; scope correction only, no new evidence or
  completed broader research claimed.
- Follow-up: Build cross-user/scenario evidence and test shared versus distinct
  needs before setting first-release priorities.

### 2026-09-23 - Evidence-backed workflow requirements draft

- Result: Official admissions edge cases, external survey and qualitative study,
  alternative-service scope, two explicitly labelled desk walkthroughs and eight
  candidate requirements with acceptance tasks and open evidence gaps.
- Changed: docs/constraints/mentor-workflow-evidence.md, constraints index,
  product overview/milestones, documentation navigation and AI LOG.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  and `git diff --check` passed. Source receipt renderer succeeded (six findings).
- Evidence limits: Source facts distinguished from product inferences; no student
  observation, causal effect, time-saving measurement or automated crawling.
  Yanbridge description readable; main-site request timed out, capabilities not
  exhaustively tested. P1 remains open; priorities are provisional.

### 2026-09-23 - Make reusable workflow the product acceptance target

- Result: User mentor search is the first real pilot; lists and research are
  intermediate outputs. Defined six workflow steps, user/tool roles, manual
  gap tracking and changed-preference replay; no generic workflow builder.
- Changed: AGENTS.md, product overview/milestones, AIDS research reference and AI LOG.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  and `git diff --check` passed; documentation only, no runtime validation claimed.
- Follow-up: Execute the pilot and replay, then scope prototype/collection from
  observed gaps. Neither pilot nor replay is claimed complete.

### 2026-09-23 - AIDS mentor direction and source research

- Result: Ten named direction-screening samples, recruiting channels, direction
  exploration exercises, lab comparison questions and a scoped collection pilot
  recorded in docs/constraints/aids-mentor-research.md.
- Changed: Research reference, product overview/milestones, constraints index,
  MkDocs navigation and AI LOG. User favors research; AI4M means AI for Math;
  employment remains a separate comparison lens for other students.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  passed; `git diff --check` passed. Public sources read; no crawler or runtime
  behavior implemented or tested.
- Limits: This is not ten verified openings or a completed P1 sample set.
  Admission years, recent-work deep reads and actual advising experience remain
  to be checked; US/HK/institute coverage needs expansion.

### 2026-09-23 - Select mentor discovery as the first use case

- Result: User selected mentor information for third-year students preparing
  postgraduate study, covering USTC, other mainland universities, institutes,
  Hong Kong and the US, without restricting disciplines.
- Changed: Product overview, roadmap, constraints index, mentor-source-reference,
  documentation navigation and AI LOG. Other opportunity types remain deferred.
- Evidence: Nine official source entry points recorded with read/discovery status;
  these are not nine verified available positions or the completed 20–30 mentors.
- Decisions: Associate mentors/groups with degree programs and intake-specific
  notices; distinguish recommendation admission, overseas applications and research
  internships. Do not infer openings from profile existence or a student's year.
- Verification: Public official-source searches and page reads; temporary-cache
  documentation build and `git diff --check` passed. No runtime changes.
- Follow-up: Complete specific mentor records, broaden disciplines, associate
  application guidance and evaluate supply/maintenance in P1.

### 2026-09-23 - Add personal activity and notice subscriptions as a candidate

- Result: Added user-proposed Xingce entry-discovery problem, activity/notice
  aggregation, opt-in updates and reminders to product research scope.
- Changed: Product overview, P1-07 in milestones, and AI LOG.
- Decisions: No community or organizer-onboarding dependency. Channel, frequency
  and first-release priority remain open; existing official services need checking.
- Verification: Documentation build with temporary uv cache and `git diff --check`.
  No runtime changes, subscriptions created or external notifications sent.

### 2026-09-23 - Clarify initial product as a personal-use tool

- Result: Replaced community-cold-start framing with explicit individual-use
  scope. Community is only a potential future extension, not a planned phase;
  editorial information maintenance is distinct from user community features.
- Changed: Product overview, milestones, README, docs index and AGENTS.md.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  and `git diff --check`. No runtime code changed.
- Follow-up: P1 research remains pending under the clarified scope.

### 2026-09-22 - Reset active product baseline and retire community roadmap

- Result: Replaced product overview with opportunity discovery and contextual
  guidance requirements; introduced P1-P5 roadmap and concrete P1 research tasks.
  Retired old M-series future tasks and preserved the original roadmap as history.
- Changed: Product overview/milestones, AGENTS, README, docs home and constraints
  index; historical banners on old product references and initialization spec;
  pending-reassessment notices on legacy privacy/auth/desktop/governance docs;
  navigation labels distinguish historical references.
- Decisions: Cross-campus and cross-disciplinary coverage, single-user value,
  external information supply, no default community/SSO/desktop prerequisites.
  MVP details remain proposed pending P1/P2; runtime assets are not presumed useful.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh`
  and `git diff --check` passed. Default-cache build initially failed because
  ~/.cache/uv was read-only; temporary cache resolved it. No runtime code changed
  or runtime readiness revalidated. Remote issues and PRs were not modified.
- Follow-up: P1 research in todo.md; evaluate existing assets during P2.

### 2026-09-22 - Organize opportunity platform development plan

- Result: Organized agreed direction, open needs, proposed MVP, user journeys,
  information supply, engineering design, incremental delivery and validation.
- Decisions: Serve USTC users initially with cross-campus, cross-disciplinary
  research, competition and internship information plus contextual guidance.
  Prioritize single-user discovery-to-action value over community growth.
- Changed: AI LOG only; planning delivered in conversation as a proposal.
- Verification: Read product overview, milestones, constraints index and package
  scripts; `git diff --check`. No runtime checks needed for log-only changes.
- Follow-up: Align formal product docs and future milestones with the revised
  direction before business implementation; current community scope is stale
  relative to this conversation. Existing runtime readiness was not revalidated.

### 2026-09-22 - Value-first needs research and VISTA counterexample

- Result: Found USTC VISTA's 2025 upgrade already covers exchange applications,
  documents, travel preparation and return workflows; 2021 documentation also
  described interest-based recommendations. Downgraded generic SOLO replication.
- Evidence: [VISTA upgrade](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/cn_mobile/xwgg_show/2201.html),
  [2026 local student event](https://physics.ustc.edu.cn/2026/0613/c23786a744381/page.htm),
  [REU guidance](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011573),
  [early-feedback study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16052),
  [existing planner](https://mystudylife.com/tour/).
- Decisions: Value means less application preparation work or easier progress on
  complex assignments. Source links are supporting usability, not the product
  pitch. Do not infer software adoption from anecdotes, service descriptions or
  the existence of procrastination. Keep application and coursework hypotheses
  separate pending better local evidence.
- Changed: AI LOG only; no product spec or implementation changes.
- Verification: Public web searches and primary-source reads on 2026-09-22;
  `git diff --check`. VISTA authenticated coverage was not tested.
- Follow-up: No questionnaire needed for this desk-research stage. If choosing
  between the two hypotheses remains blocked, examine a few actual student
  workflows before surveying prevalence. No outreach conducted.

### 2026-09-22 - Deepen SOLO and Assignment Calculator cases

- Result: Examined SOLO discovery, application dependencies and program-officer
  lifecycle; compared Minnesota research-paper, speech, lab-report and dissertation
  templates and evidence of reuse at other colleges.
- Evidence: [SOLO](https://solo.stanford.edu/about),
  [research opportunity](https://solo.stanford.edu/opportunities/2026-27-ay-pt-research-fellowship-thirsting-solutions),
  [calculator](https://www.lib.umn.edu/services/ac),
  [McDaniel adaptation](https://hoover.mcdaniel.edu/calculator/).
- Decisions: Separate verified features from proposed AI extraction, comparison,
  requirement provenance and replanning. Prefer a narrow personal application
  workspace; USTC already has research-plan application and review workflows.
- Changed: AI LOG only; detailed findings delivered in conversation.
- Verification: Public primary-source page reads and searches on 2026-09-22;
  `git diff --check`. No authenticated workflows, date-form interactions or
  effectiveness study tested; no claim of a proven USTC-wide service gap.
- Follow-up: Compare a prototype against source pages plus generic AI using real
  notices and a small user sample before committing to product scope.

### 2026-09-22 - Reassess single-user campus tools

- Result: Benchmarked NUSMods, Cornell Scheduler, Princeton ReCal, Tsinghua
  Learn Helper, Stanford SOLO, Cambridge Spacefinder, and Minnesota Assignment
  Calculator against the user's single-user-value and external-data criteria.
- Evidence: [NUSMods data](https://api.nusmods.com/v2/),
  [SOLO](https://solo.stanford.edu/about),
  [Spacefinder](https://spacefinder.lib.cam.ac.uk/),
  [Assignment Calculator](https://www.lib.umn.edu/services/ac),
  [Learn Helper](https://github.com/Harry-Chen/Learn-Helper).
- Counterexamples: [Life@USTC](https://github.com/Life-USTC/Life-USTC) already
  documents academic information aggregation; [class-arrange](https://github.com/RaymondzyLei/class-arrange)
  documents local scheduling and conflict checking; USTC library already offers
  space booking. Repository descriptions are not proof of tested reliability.
- Decisions: Prefer personal opportunity comparison/preparation, task planning
  grounded in requirements, or purpose-based space discovery. Existing university
  data supply and institutional integrations cannot be assumed transferable.
- Changed: AI LOG only; recommendations delivered in conversation.
- Verification: Public primary-source searches and page reads on 2026-09-22;
  `git diff --check`. No usage study or authenticated product testing.
- Follow-up: Validate narrow tasks against existing tools and generic AI before
  accepting any proposed feature gap or changing implementation milestones.

### 2026-09-22 - Deepen research on collaboration and activity discovery

- Result: Found stronger existing-service overlap and narrowed both proposals.
  USTC Geek Centers and the academic-practice platform already support early
  research entry; the portal manual documents topic subscriptions and calendars.
- Evidence: [2026 Geek Centers exchange](https://news.ustc.edu.cn/info/1055/94805.htm),
  [portal announcement and manual](https://ustcnet.ustc.edu.cn/2025/0416/c33496a680486/page.htm),
  [existing mail/calendar tool](https://git.ustc.edu.cn/ustcnic/ai/-/merge_requests/115),
  [MIT expectations](https://urop.mit.edu/mentors/resources/urop-experience/),
  [Berkeley applications](https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/application/),
  [EPFL projects](https://make.epfl.ch/projects),
  [Michigan event feeds](https://events.umich.edu/feeds).
- Changed: AI LOG only. Detailed comparison delivered in conversation.
- Verification: Public primary-source searches, page reads, portal manual text,
  and `git diff --check`; no authenticated platform walkthrough or user study.
- Decisions: Short research trials are a proposed experiment, not an established
  local demand. Prioritize explicit project roles/commitments or event lifecycle
  and participation fit; avoid duplicating generic listings and subscriptions.
- Follow-up: Inspect academic-practice and portal functions with authorized users;
  validate organizer supply and participant outcomes before implementation.

### 2026-09-22 - Research campus software opportunities

- Result: Compared public USTC services with SJTU Shuiyuan, UBC Wiki, MIT UROP,
  Michigan Maize Pages, Stanford Carta, and Tsinghua's student AI assistant;
  delivered research and prototype recommendations in the conversation.
- Changed: AI LOG only; no runtime or milestone changes.
- Evidence: [USTC research-plan notice](https://www.teach.ustc.edu.cn/notice/notice-teaching/19630.html),
  [USTC navigation](https://ustc.life/), [model platform](https://llm.ustc.edu.cn/guide/),
  [Shuiyuan guide](https://welcome.sjtu.edu.cn/info/1025/1382.htm),
  [MIT UROP](https://urop.mit.edu/), [Maize Pages](https://maizepages.umich.edu/),
  [Tsinghua assistant](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1176/114345.htm).
- Verification: Public web searches and page reads on 2026-09-22; `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: Existing forums, course reviews, campus encyclopedia, research
  applications, activity services, and model access are not blank-slate gaps.
  Recommended validating knowledge maintenance, short research collaborations,
  and cross-source activity discovery; Web 4.0 remains framing, not a requirement.
- Follow-up: Demand and private-system coverage require student interviews and
  authorized campus walkthroughs before changing product scope. No claim of
  nationwide absence or current forum participation levels was established.

### 2026-07-06 - 明确工具目录和文档时效规则

- Result: 新增 `tools/README.md`，并在 `AGENTS.md` 中明确长期文档的更新时间规则。
- Changed: `tools/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ai-log/done.md`。
- Verification: `env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs`, `git diff --check` 和工作区状态检查。
- Decisions: 使用 `README.md` 作为工具目录说明文件；长期文档在实质更新时维护 `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD`。
- Follow-up: 后续移动工具配置或更新决策性文档时，同步更新时间并核对代码、脚本和 CI。

### 2026-07-06 - 收纳根目录工具配置

- Result: 将文档构建配置和 API 镜像 Dockerfile 从根目录移入工具目录，减少根目录配置文件数量。
- Changed: `tools/docs/*`, `docker/api/Dockerfile`, root scripts, README, engineering and deployment docs, active spec。
- Verification: `env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs`, `docker build --check -f docker/api/Dockerfile .`, `bash -n scripts/ci/docs.sh scripts/ci/container.sh`, `git diff --check` 和旧路径扫描。
- Decisions: 保留 `package.json`、`Cargo.toml`、lockfiles、Git 与编辑器配置在仓库根目录，保证工具默认发现路径稳定。
- Follow-up: 若继续收纳配置，优先只移动可显式传参的工具配置；不要破坏 Bun、Cargo、Git、编辑器默认发现路径。

### 2026-07-06 - 清理约束参考文档语气

- Result: 将约束参考、里程碑和 MkDocs 入口调整为中文项目参考语气，移除回答式措辞。
- Changed: `docs/constraints/*`, `docs/product/milestones.md`, `docs/index.md`, `mkdocs.yml`。
- Verification: `env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run ci:docs`、`git diff --check` 和措辞扫描。
- Decisions: 保留参考文档与正式文档的分层；约束参考继续作为细节清单，已接受要求仍需提升到正式文档或里程碑。
- Follow-up: 后续补充 `docs/constraints/` 时继续使用项目参考语气，避免复制聊天回答格式。

### 2026-07-06 - Promote reference notes into docs constraints

- Result: Moved root-level local reference notes into publishable
  `docs/constraints/` files and expanded milestone tracking.
- Changed: Added constraint reference docs and reading map, updated MkDocs nav,
  expanded `docs/product/milestones.md`, updated `AGENTS.md` collaboration
  rules, and linked constraints from the docs index.
- Verification: `env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run
  ci:docs`, `git diff --check`, and old project-name scan over AGENTS.md,
  docs, and MkDocs config.
- Decisions: Kept constraint references separate from formal architecture and
  product docs. Accepted rules should be promoted into formal docs and
  milestones when implemented.
- Follow-up: Keep future durable reference notes under `docs/constraints/`
  instead of the repository root.

### 2026-07-06 - Resolve M0 review findings after PR #2 merge

- Result: Addressed the post-rebase M0/M0.1/M0.2 review findings on PR #3.
- Changed: Flattened API `ErrorResponse`, regenerated OpenAPI and TypeScript
  contract types, updated API client error normalization, added CORS allowlist
  and request body limit middleware, expanded API tests, and corrected
  governance docs for roles and retention.
- Verification: `bun run api:types`, `cargo test -p campus_agora_api --test
  health`, `cargo test -p campus_agora_api --test openapi`,
  `bun --cwd packages/api-client test`, `cargo test -p campus_agora_api`,
  `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`, `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`, `bun run
  ci:frontend`, `env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bun run
  ci:docs`, and `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: Kept the generated contract as the source of TypeScript response
  types, while the API client still accepts the old nested error shape for
  compatibility. Runtime CORS and body limit controls were implemented because
  the canonical spec already listed them in initialization scope.
- Follow-up: PR CI should still cover Docker/socket-backed checks that this
  sandbox cannot run directly.

### 2026-07-06 - Implement M0.2 governance docs and boundaries

- Result: Added formal M0.2 documentation for product scope, privacy,
  milestones, architecture, backend, auth/permissions, desktop, LFS, quality,
  operations, security, and deployment boundaries.
- Changed: `docs/product/*`, `docs/architecture/{overview,backend,auth-permissions,desktop}.md`,
  `docs/engineering/lfs.md`, expanded development/quality/deployment docs,
  updated `docs/index.md`, `mkdocs.yml`, README, AI LOG, and the M0.2 plan.
- Verification: `bun run ci:docs`, `test ! -d site/superpowers/specs`,
  `test ! -d site/superpowers/plans`, `git diff --check`, and placeholder
  scan over formal docs.
- Decisions: Kept M0.2 documentation-only; no runtime behavior, dependencies,
  APIs, database schema, or CI topology changed.
- Follow-up: After M0.1 merges, publish M0.2 as a follow-up PR or rebase this
  stacked branch onto `main`.

### 2026-07-06 - Rename automation folder to scripts

- Result: Renamed the repository automation directory to `scripts/`.
- Changed: Updated `package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, README,
  engineering docs, active M0.1 plan/spec, and existing AI LOG references.
- Verification: stale singular-path scan, `test ! -d script`, `test -d
  scripts`, `bash -n scripts/build.sh scripts/ci/*.sh`, `bun run build:all`,
  `bun run ci:docs`, and `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: Kept the same script layout under the more conventional plural
  directory name.
- Follow-up: Use `scripts/` for future repository automation.

### 2026-07-06 - Add repository automation scripts

- Result: Added shared repository automation scripts for local builds and CI
  job parity.
- Changed: Added `scripts/README.md`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/ci/*.sh`,
  `bun run ci:*`, and `bun run build:all`; updated CI jobs to call scripts;
  documented the workflow split policy in README, engineering docs, the active
  spec, and the M0.1 plan.
- Verification: `bash -n scripts/build.sh scripts/ci/*.sh`, `bun run
  ci:frontend`, `bun run ci:contract`, `bun run ci:desktop`, `bun run
  ci:docs`, `bun run build:all`,
  `DATABASE_URL=postgres://campus_agora:campus_agora@127.0.0.1:55435/campus_agora bun run ci:backend`,
  `bun run ci:container`, and `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: Kept CI in one `.github/workflows/ci.yml` because all jobs share
  the same pull request and `main` push triggers. Scripts now carry command
  reuse; workflow files should split later only for different triggers,
  permissions, deployment lifecycles, or schedules.
- Follow-up: Add new CI scripts only when a workflow gains a distinct local
  reproduction command.

### 2026-07-06 - Switch docs tooling to uv

- Result: Replaced the MkDocs `requirements-docs.txt` flow with uv project
  metadata.
- Changed: Added `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, deleted
  `requirements-docs.txt`, updated `docs:build`, CI docs job, README, quality
  docs, development docs, and the active spec/plan references.
- Verification: `uv lock`, `bun run docs:build`,
  `test ! -d site/superpowers/specs`, `test ! -d site/superpowers/plans`,
  `rg -n "requirements-docs|setup-python|python -m pip|pip install" ...`,
  and `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: CI uses `astral-sh/setup-uv@v6` and runs
  `uv run --locked mkdocs build --strict` directly, without installing Bun in
  the docs job.
- Follow-up: Add future MkDocs themes or plugins to `pyproject.toml`, then
  refresh `uv.lock`.

### 2026-07-06 - Implement M0.1 contract and quality gates

- Result: Added the M0.1 engineering quality loop around the repository
  skeleton.
- Changed: API readiness, request IDs, JSON error shape, OpenAPI export,
  committed contract snapshot, generated TypeScript API types, API client mock
  fetch, API client tests, initial SQL migration, `.env.example`, MkDocs
  config, uv-backed docs tooling, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions CI, README
  commands, and M0.1 plan.
- Verification: `bun run api:types`, hash comparison for
  `contracts/openapi.json` and `packages/api-client/src/generated.ts`,
  `bun run lint`, `bun run lint:styles`, `bun run typecheck`,
  `bun run build`, `bun run test`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo check --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`,
  `cargo fmt --all --check`,
  `cargo fmt --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check`,
  `uv run --locked mkdocs build --strict`,
  `test ! -d site/superpowers/specs`, `test ! -d site/superpowers/plans`,
  `docker build -f Dockerfile.api .`, temporary PostgreSQL 16 container
  readiness via `docker exec ... pg_isready`,
  `DATABASE_URL=postgres://campus_agora:campus_agora@127.0.0.1:55432/campus_agora cargo sqlx migrate run --source crates/db/migrations`,
  and `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: Used a minimal deterministic local OpenAPI/TypeScript generator
  instead of adding a heavier OpenAPI codegen dependency in M0.1.
- Follow-up: No remaining local Docker/sqlx blocker; rerun the same migration
  smoke test when migrations change.

### 2026-07-06 - Define AI collaboration rules

- Result: Added project-level AI collaboration rules and created AI LOG files.
- Changed: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ai-log/todo.md`, and `docs/ai-log/done.md`.
- Verification: `git diff --check` and
  `rg -n "[ \t]+$" AGENTS.md docs/ai-log/todo.md docs/ai-log/done.md`.
- Decisions: Kept the rule set lightweight in `AGENTS.md`; deferred a fuller
  engineering guide to M0.2 governance docs.
- Follow-up: Apply the AI LOG workflow to future non-trivial agent tasks.

### 2026-07-06 - Initialize M0 repository skeleton

- Result: Created the runnable Campus Agora M0 skeleton and merged it through
  PR #1.
- Changed: Web app, Tauri shell, Rust workspace, API client package, workspace
  scripts, Apache-2.0 license, repository metadata, and M0 implementation plan.
- Verification: `bun run lint`, `bun run lint:styles`, `bun run typecheck`,
  `bun run build`, `bun run test`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo check --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`,
  `cargo fmt --all --check`,
  `cargo fmt --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check`, and
  `git diff --check`.
- Decisions: Kept M0 limited to a runnable skeleton; deferred contract
  generation, CI hardening, governance docs, and MkDocs publishing to later
  milestones.
- Follow-up: Start M0.1 contract and quality gates.

### 2026-07-06 - Compress repository history

- Result: Rewrote `main` into a two-commit history.
- Changed: Squashed previous docs/spec iteration commits into
  `docs: add campus agora initialization spec`, followed by
  `chore: initialize m0 repository skeleton`.
- Verification: Compared the rewritten `HEAD` with the previous remote `main`
  tree and confirmed no file content diff.
- Decisions: Kept the final project tree unchanged while making history easier
  to review.
- Follow-up: Future history rewrites should be explicit user requests.


### 2026-09-24 - Preparation guidance evidence and product focus

- Expanded docs/constraints/opportunity-needs-map.md with five primary-source cases, five illustrative preparation cards and G8–G11 candidate needs.
- Updated docs/product/overview.md and milestones.md: task understanding and preparation are central; application handling redirects to official services after key conditions and dates. Prepared users may skip guidance.
- Distinguished basic requirements, preferred qualifications, suggested exercises and participation support. No user-testing or runtime-completion claim.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- Follow-up: real task comparisons and maintenance measurement; scope remains product-wide, AIDS is the first pilot only.


### 2026-09-24 - Three source-backed preparation cards

- Expanded docs/constraints/opportunity-needs-map.md with AlphaEdit, BCG simulation and historical physics competition cards, same-task source comparisons, supply gaps and observation tasks; updated P1-13 in milestones.md.
- Found AlphaEdit repository states at least one A40 48GB GPU; separated reading from experiment preparation. Existing BCG task feedback should be linked rather than presumed missing. Competition appendix remains unread and signup historical.
- Verification: docs strict build and git diff --check passed. No runtime change, external registration, actual student test or measured per-card production time.
- Next: observe varied users and measure content work independently; narrow preparation depth before implementing.


### 2026-09-24 - Resource discovery and access

- Added official compute, library, equipment and research-support evidence to opportunity-needs-map.md and linked resources to preparation tasks. Updated overview.md and milestone P1-14/G12.
- Distinguished supercomputer registration from AI platform applications; AI training-job application says pending launch. Machine-time spending limit is not free credit. Literature subsidy and historical project funding are conditional.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed. No login, application or actual resource allocation tested.
- Follow-up: task observation, eligibility/compatibility and maintenance validation.


### 2026-09-24 - Consolidated requirements baseline

- Added docs/product/requirements.md: N01–N12 with G/R evidence mapping, candidate priorities, complete and exception flows, content/personal-use constraints, supply validation, V1–V5 and decision gates.
- Updated overview, milestones/P1-15, mentor-workflow-evidence and MkDocs navigation; corrected residual application-procedure emphasis.
- Candidate priorities are recommendations, not measured user demand or a finalized implementation scope. Content prototyping can now inform P1; broad research scope remains intact.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh` and `git diff --check` passed. No runtime or user test performed.
- Next: content prototype and focused task/cost validation, not additional case counts for their own sake.


### 2026-09-24 - Clickable local content prototype

- Created tools/prototypes/opportunities.html and README.md; six evidence-based records, search/filter/empty state, comparison, preparation/resource links, local saved notes and next steps. Temporary display name is not a project rename.
- Updated requirements/milestones; prototype is separate from production app, with static content and no backend or live collection.
- Verification: Playwright via `/tmp/check-campus-prototype.cjs` passed search/reset, comparison, escaped notes, save/reload/next steps, resource/history statuses, 390px overflow and no page errors. Desktop/mobile screenshots visually inspected. Default browser missing; installed Chromium 1228 used successfully.
- Strict docs build and git diff --check passed. Production app unchanged; no full production CI claimed.
- Follow-up: actual task observation and content maintenance timing; prototype lacks preference editing and live updates. Local preview server bound only to 127.0.0.1:8765.


### 2026-09-24 - UI library and visual policy locked

- Selected Primer React Product UI + Primitives + Octicons; light neutral palette, standard Primer blue interaction, system sans-serif and normal tracking.
- Added docs/product/ui-system.md; replaced conflicting frontend-reference.md, updated AGENTS, overview/milestones, constraints index, navigation and prototype README.
- Read requested 107 workspace VIS reference: CMYK is not official HEX; its blue web adaptation is a candidate. Reused neutral/semantic color principles, not its assets or card patterns. Compared official Primer and Ant Design docs and GitHub list structure.
- Explicitly banned emoji icons, eyebrows, subtitles, gradients, bordered content cards, Tailwind and handwritten styles including inline style/sx workarounds.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed. No runtime dependency or style migration claimed; previous HTML visual is superseded, content can be reused.
- Next: migrate content prototype using exact-pinned Primer dependencies and verify UI restrictions and interactions.


### 2026-09-24 - Persisted requirements-analysis contract

- Added eight required sections, evidence and completion criteria, need/solution distinction and analysis-first order to docs/product/requirements.md.
- Synchronized AGENTS.md, overview.md, milestones.md and todo priority so prototype/UI work cannot silently displace the analysis.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed. This records the contract; the full analysis report remains pending.


### 2026-09-29 - Version-aware review and advisor participation structure

- Fast-forwarded local checkout to PR #10 commit feb4549 before editing; preserved teammate v0.6 decisions and the untracked legacy prototype. No remote merge or push.
- Updated requirements-handoff.md to v0.7, synchronized overview.md and needs-analysis.md, and appended review disposition, Arno/MIT comparison, four real material cases and bounded supply proposal to mentor-workflow-evidence.md.
- Reused the earlier browser inspection of Arno; freshly read MIT policy, HKUST visiting rules, USTC faculty intake page and official RSTAR launch notice. Existing ICT evidence reused with its original date; failed UROP/RSTAR direct fetches do not count as body evidence.
- Separated person from participation route, scoped conditions from general school guidance, experience evidence from questions, and corrected handoff readability/status inconsistencies. No user test or sustainable supply claim.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh and git diff --check passed. Documentation-only work; no runtime checks needed.
- Follow-up: finite content trial with actual research work/usable experience material and maintenance timing; owner and release coverage remain unresolved. Changes remain local.


### 2026-09-29 - Four-candidate advisor content pilot

- Added comparable research questions, participation routes, experience gaps and optional next steps for Xiang Wang, Yingfei Xiong, Tianqi Chen and Charles Zhang to tools/prototypes/opportunity-content.md; detailed source/failed-link records in docs/constraints/mentor-source-reference.md; progress linked from requirements-handoff.md.
- Six route checks comprise four explicit faculty statements, one institutional relationship and one unconfirmed visiting path; not six open opportunities. Alumnus self-description corroborates one advisor relationship/career record, not mentoring quality.
- Source-reading/assembly/check interval 14:43:48–14:46:30 UTC, 162 seconds. Reused prior research; not per-record human effort or recurring maintenance measurement. No contacts, crawlers or user tests.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed; local Markdown links from content sample checked for file existence. No runtime changes. Changes remain local, not pushed.
- Follow-up: actual update timing, missing individual admission/visiting links and usable first-person guidance evidence; do not expand samples just to fill counts.


### 2026-09-30 - Advisor task and information design v0.1

- Created docs/product/advisor-task-design.md with entry paths, result/detail/comparison contents, direct resource lookup, private records, conceptual relationships, six desk checks and prototype acceptance mapped to existing N identifiers.
- Reused four-candidate specimens; separated route/eligibility from interest, source status from intake status, and records from actual mentoring experience. No new browsing, participant results, runtime implementation or data supply claims.
- Linked design in overview.md, milestones.md, requirements-handoff.md and MkDocs navigation; next work is a finite Primer interaction prototype, not automatic sample expansion. Session-only prototype storage cannot establish return value.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh; git diff --check; design relative links checked for existing files. All passed. Runtime tests not applicable to this documentation change.
- Existing uncommitted research edits and legacy untracked HTML retained. No commit or remote push in this turn.


### 2026-09-30 - Requirements completeness reassessed with transferable evidence

- Added source-specific applicability judgments and eight-part completion matrix to needs-analysis.md; synchronized overview, milestones, handoff and active todo priority.
- Comparable task/population evidence supports common needs without a new USTC survey. Kept actual methodological limits, local rule applicability and product efficacy distinct; did not assume elite-university labels imply population equivalence.
- Conclusion: reviewable analysis, remaining convergence/decision work; prototype is no longer default next task. No new research or participant data claimed.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed. Changes remain local.


### 2026-09-30 - Persist negotiated requirements decisions

- Synchronized AGENTS.md, overview.md, needs-analysis.md, requirements.md and requirements-handoff.md (v0.8): discovery and judgment serve autonomous choice; relevant public/consented knowledgeable-contact entries support further inquiry; automation collects/organizes while the team verifies critical facts and handles exceptions/corrections.
- Future community contribution is optional information maintenance, without a scheduled community phase or an initial dependency. No automatic outreach or particular crawler/platform implementation adopted.
- Private-record continuity and actual team verification capacity remain open. Existing evidence reused; no new participant study or measured product benefit claimed.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh and git diff --check passed. Documentation only; no runtime tests required. Changes remain local, uncommitted and not pushed.


### 2026-09-30 - Multi-session product references

- Read official Perplexity Projects, Zotero collections, Gemini Notebook and Notion Web Clipper documentation; appended facts, proposal and existing-tool substitution analysis to mentor-workflow-evidence.md; linked needs-analysis.md and overview.md.
- User proposed multiple sessions. Persistent exploration topics versus individual queries remain a design proposal, not fully approved functionality. No product hands-on trial or student efficacy claim.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed after correcting section links. Documentation-only, local changes; no commit/push.


### 2026-10-01 - Competition demo value and bounded maintenance

- Updated AGENTS.md and product overview, needs-analysis, requirements, milestones and handoff (v0.9) to prioritize demonstrating relevant information discovery/organization; ongoing maintenance staffing and schedules are deferred rather than demo gates.
- Dated information remains useful for discovery with its time/use stated; historical recruitment is not current availability. Fixed specimens and executed automated collection remain distinct. No runtime work or effectiveness claims.
- Cleared obsolete maintenance-capacity prerequisite from current convergence todo. Long-term service remains conditional on demonstrated value and a later investment decision.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh and git diff --check passed. Local documentation changes only; not committed or pushed.


### 2026-10-01 - Requirements alignment for demo review

- Unified N01–N13 adoption states in requirements.md; retained multi-session structure as proposed. Added source-reusing alternative/increment conclusions to needs-analysis.md and task-based demo checks to requirements-handoff.md v0.10.
- Rewrote active milestone work order; P3 is the competition demo and continued service is conditional. Moved old AI-log research tasks into an explicitly conditional historical backlog; removed active maintenance timing/staffing gates from handoff and requirements sections.
- Synchronized overview and completeness conclusions. No fresh survey, user test, runtime implementation or claim that teammate review passed. Session organization and review remain open.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh and git diff --check passed; inspected remaining maintenance/gate wording. Fixed a documentation-site link warning by using a repository path for the non-published content specimen.
- All changes remain local; existing unrelated research edits and legacy HTML retained, no commit/push.


### 2026-10-01 - Actual discovery demo accepted; implementation layering proposed

- User accepted option B. Updated overview, requirements and handoff: actual external search/read/organization is required in addition to existing-data exploration; cached fallback is identified as such.
- Appended official Agent Skills and Anthropic workflow references plus proposed procedure/tool/data/topic separation to mentor-workflow-evidence.md. No skill, crawler, SDK or architecture chosen or implemented; multi-topic organization remains a recommendation.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed. Local documentation only, no push.


### 2026-10-01 - Exploration and discovery decisions accepted

- User accepted multiple persistent exploration topics and existing-data reuse plus external search/read/organization. Synchronized overview, needs-analysis, requirements, handoff, milestones, workflow evidence and AGENTS.md; removed obsolete session-confirmation todo.
- No further product-direction decision identified as blocking requirements handoff. Providers, storage, interaction details and actual performance remain design/technical validation work; runtime is not implemented by this documentation change.
- Verification: strict docs build and git diff --check passed. Changes local, not committed/pushed.


### 2026-10-01 - Requirements analysis v1.0 consolidated

- Rewrote requirements-handoff.md into the standalone eight-part v1.0 baseline: broad user/tasks, evidence, alternatives, P/N needs, adopted scope, multi-topic/live-discovery workflow, demo acceptance and downstream unknowns. Retained nine direct evidence entries and research reading map; no new research or effectiveness claims.
- Replaced accumulated overview and requirements draft with concise current summary and v1.0 analysis contract/N01–N13 companion. needs-analysis.md remains detailed reasoning/history with original H/V definitions; prior convergence notes retained in its appendix.
- Synchronized docs index, MkDocs navigation, milestones, AGENTS and task-design status. Design v0.1 explicitly requires updating for multi-topic/live discovery; v1.0 is not teammate approval, runtime completion or sustainable supply validation.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh; git diff --check; checked eight headings, N01–N13 coverage, nine retained source rows and local links. All passed after EOF whitespace correction. Documentation only, no runtime tests applicable.
- Local only, not committed/pushed. Next: teammate review and task/information design based on v1.0; preserve unrelated existing edits and legacy untracked prototype.


### 2026-10-01 - Requirements v1.0 review and corrections

- Reviewed main analysis, detailed N table, overview, milestones, design draft and existing source records. Findings corrected: old design could imply fixed samples suffice and maintenance staffing precedes demo; live-discovery criterion did not explicitly require relevant source body/content; persistence boundary and independent topic edits were underspecified; N02/N09 attribution omitted direct user decisions.
- Updated requirements-handoff.md, requirements.md, advisor-task-design.md and milestones.md. Main v1.0 retained; changes clarify accepted behavior, not new implementation scope. Design still needs concrete multi-topic/live-discovery interaction work.
- Existing evidence counts and study boundaries checked against local research records, not fresh external source verification. No user effect or runtime check claimed.
- Verification: strict docs build, git diff --check, eight-part structure, N01–N13, nine source entries, local links and clarified acceptance checks passed. All changes local, no commit/push.


### 2026-10-01 - Publish requirements analysis v1.0 on PR 10

- Submitted the local v1.0 consolidation, including docs/product/advisor-task-design.md, onto branch docs/requirements-handoff for the existing requirements PR.
- Left tools/prototypes/opportunities.html untracked. No runtime code, dependency, or product-implementation files are in this publication.
- Peer review remains pending. Publication does not merge the PR, approve v1.0, or claim measured user benefit, completed P1 validation, or a finished supply pipeline.
- Verification: UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/campus-agora-uv-cache bash scripts/ci/docs.sh and git diff --check, recorded with this commit.
